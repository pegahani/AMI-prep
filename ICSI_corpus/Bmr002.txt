C : I think that's recording now.
B : I'm talking on mike two.
B : Mike number two,  now  on?
B : Mike  number two?
B : Channel  one?
B : Is that channel one  zero?
C : Let me make sure .
B : which is zero-based  one-based?
B : O_K, So we're not  going to do that. O_K.
C : Unfortunately the mikes are you know  -
A : off  by one.
B : Wh- that's why I wanted to write it down,
B : Dan just doesn't
C : I mean  Write down whatever you like.
D : cuz we want to start the meeting.
B : O_K, now, that means - if I'm  there
C : I  know.
D : Oh!
D : Oh! This
B : then someone else  down.
D : Oh! I like  this.
B : because I won-
C : The weird  thing is that
D : I like this.
B : Let's not try easy.
D : I  much  more comfortable.
D : I could have it more at the midline.
D : Boy!  very  adjustable  now.
A : So go ahead .
D : I'm  four.
B : They're in the folder right there.
B : You may.
B : So, Jane,  talk  mike?  four?
B : I'm glad  like  it.
B : @@  Uh
B : Eric,  mike  are you?
A : Mike  zero,  probably.
A : Channel zero.
C : mike three.
C : This is mike three,
D : speaking
B : Um, can you do taps on the P_D_As?
B : P_Z_Ms? And you have to actually check what the nu-
C : P_Z_Ms? or - not  P_Z_Ms?
B : Start  with P_Z_Ms.
C : Because this  three.
C : This is the next one in, which is P_Z_M number four,
C : apparently.
B : I can't tell.
C : What- Can you - can you see other  stuff happening?
B : Yep.
C : This is P_Z_M number four.
D : That's  a good way.
A : This is P_Z_M two.
B : F_
B : O_K.
C : I mean
B : And P_D_A,
C : It's all hopeless.
C : This is uh one side of P_D_A, I guess.
C : We could actually give  names,  right?
C : This would be left,  wouldn't
B : I don't see
C : I know, asking.
A : Huh-uh.
C : I wasn't asking
C : This is - this is P_D_A  left.
C : You getting something there?
C : And this is P_D_A  right.
B : All  O_K.
C : Because it depends which one of these
B : Did we  record  start  over?
C : shows more consistency  then.
C : Well, we're w- we're so  ahead of the game now, cuz we've got
C : built-in downsampling  now.
C : We've got built-in  downsampling.
C : And so it's only recording sixteen kilohertz data, and we've got -
A : Wait  a second.
B : The ones that aren't  ones  hand  out.
C : What about the ones that we didn't  record?
B : I threw  ones   out,  that we already
B : recorded but we didn't record.
C : Then it doesn't matter,  does  it.
D : brought you all here today.
C : Before  that.
A : Before  that.
B : And
B : This is Adam  on
B : mike number two,

D : So, I'm - I'm on uh number four
D : with the microphone   around my neck
D : read these.
B : So you wanna pause  briefly between each one
B : so that the person transcribing can tell where one ends and one begins.
C : And -
D : It really  sentences.
B : Well, intone  want.  Imagine that you're
D : somewhat  sentence  intonation.
B : reading a number - phone  number to someone.
D : O_K.

B : Good.  Thanks.
B : So we'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting.
D : If I were to be dictating a phone  number, I would have done that
D : more slowly,  but
D : easier  for the -
D : for the machine.
C : It's kind of weird.
C : That was great,  did.
B : What- what's your mike  Jane?
D : uh  within the constraints.
B : Dan  sex  he is.
C : Yeah, cuz I figure  figure  out
C : from the - from my name.  So,
B : Well, don't you - I - I wrote a scanner  scans  forms  in.
C : @@
B : Anyway.  why  call  you all here?
B : Um, what I'd like  to talk about is, um
D : Oh, you  did.
B : So, as part  project,  transcribe  meetings.
B : um, to do training  test  and so on.
B : word  transcripts
B : uh, speaker change  identification.
B : So, speaker  I_D.
B : so I'd sort of like to know who's
B : and uh
B : what  need,
B : and also  what we -
B : how  do  it.
A : how exactly you got roped into  this.
D : Oh.
B : Oh really? Cuz Morgan said he asked  you.
D : Oh, uh he did.
D : and - and I approved.
A : That would be my  fault.
D : and, in which case, I thank
B : And so, one of the first  questions is,
B : "do you need help? "
C : Well, hang  on.
B : That's not  the first question.
C : Well,
C : Well, I guess.
C : What are - what are we talking  about? That you're gonna -
C : you're gonna do transcriptions?  You're going to listen to these things and -
D : w- word-level transcripts
D : I guess speaker change  in any case, so
C : Are you going to have to make up  what you do or do you have a very
C : clear  idea  do?
C : Is it like something you've done before? or -
D : I've transcribed a lot.
D : more efficiently  or
C : "Oh listen to her.  sentences! "
D : "She can't speak!"
D : So
C : " Oh,  realize  we were being recorded!"
B : Ah right.
D : Yeah.
D : "This microphone,  this  doing around my neck?"
B : Uh, that's - worry  surprised
C : It's just jewelry.
D : what I've done before  is I have a -
D : you know, if it's word  level
B : Play.
D : type what I know and then -
D : I've never  know  a   wonderful  idea.
D : in awhile.
C : The problem  is -
C : The nice  transcribers  foot  pedals,
D : my hand-held taperecorder.
C : I  see.
D : However, if we have  a transcribing machine
D : I would accept  it.
D : getting hold  of a transcriber. I think that CogSci has one.
C : I - I - I actually have  one.
D : You  yourself?
C : Well, Sarah  has one because she does a lot of
D : Oh, I see!
C : transcribing  interviews.
A : The other  thing is is that we might be -
C : The crazy  thing is we'd have to
C : convert  the s-
C : we'd have to dump  cassette.
D : Oh, I  see.
C : got them digitally
C : you know, it's quite tempting  software  thing.
C : But - but then there's the question  interface,  that -
B : I actually  have  foot  C.
A : Well, that's what I was gonna say,  is
A : that Adam has foot  probably  rig  something up to -
D : Oh, that'd be super.
C : What do they connect  to?
B : and they generate keystrokes.
C : Oh, that's totally  cool.
C : how do you decide which keystrokes  they generate?
B : There's a little program  into  it.
D : This
C : And this is Windows?
B : But the program  probably  only runs in Windows, although I bet we could
B : program it once
B : and then put it on another  machine  work.
B : I haven't  used  them.
B : I don't think  it does.
C : So hang  on. You have -
C : You have  using  them.
B : I'm not using  used  to use them.
B : So they're currently  set up
B : for Shift,  Control,  Alt.
B : But I r- I don't use  in.
C : Wow.
C : That's so cool.
D : This sounds wonderful.
B : And so tha- uh if that would help,  certainly  donate  them.
C : The part that's not  write  software.
D : Yeah, that's true.
B : And it - it is  C  somewhere.
D : Now, we're at a pilot  what I was told is that
D : And so, pilot  thing,
D : you know, of course  useful.
A : Right, this is  the pilot data.
D : I'm assuming  that I would not be
B : Yeah, yeah,  generating  it.
D : transcribing all  of it.
B : Well, that - that was part of the question,  is that if,
B : if we're doing this regularly  transcripts
B : um, of recording,
B : uh, I wouldn't  all.
B : So the question is do you know of resources  use.
B : So are there grad  undergrads  or just
D : So, Susan   E-
D : you can give them   like -
D : if you give them   a little bit of instruction and -
D : and make it interesting  them
D : or, not  two ninety-eight, what is it, one- whatever,
B : So we only  credits,
B : We don't  money?
B : Oh, you do  have to pay them.
D : of some - of some  monetary.
A : Awesome .
D : But if they feel like they're getting something out  of it,
D : sometimes you can do it that  way.
B : We  pass  that on to Morgan,
B : So - so the cheaper  better.
D : Well, you also  quality.
D : I mean, someone's  going to have to pass through -
D : Either a higher  level person will have to pass through, or you have to be sure you get
D : to begin  with.
C : Oh, O_K . So, the p-
C : hearing  is that
C : problem  of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts
D : Oh, it's very  common.
D : Yeah.
C : there are standard  solutions and we should just adopt -
C : adopt  cost  cost,
C : We're - we're probably  not  flexibility  in
C : bringing down  the cost cuz probably
C : the low cost solution's already been established.
D : I think there's always  trade-off  between uh
D : paying  more for the first pass,
D : and then editing  later.
D : paying less  more  later. So
C : I wonder if our  different  from um -
C : you know, how much time  aligned detail we need
C : I don- I don't know how much ti- I don't think we do  need any time aligned detail.
C : But.
B : Well, if - in terms of transcripts,  speaker  change it might be
C : But not if it costs
A : Well, O_K. So what happened  Switchboard
A : I mean, the output
A : speaker  turns
A : you know, " this  is where this speaker change came in"
C : Right,  I mean,
C : Switchboard  because the telephone is so -
C : then  there's a lot of overlap
B : in terms of data  do  about that?
B : you have the S_T_  M  format, where you have
B : you know, every phrase,  utterance  is - is
B : I mean, is that  right  do  it? Or -
C : every utterance is a single speaker,  right?
C : It's just that utterances can overlap.
C : I  think so.
C : Like, So, Eric  made a s- made a sentence,
C : and then I  in  there
C : and they should be just overlapping things  that -
C : I don't think that we should break  those.  I think -
B : O_K. So that means that for each utterance,  we'll need the time marks,
B : the start and end of each utterance.
C : Well, we'll have to go  somewhere
C : I mean, we - we may  transcriber  to give them to us
C : give them software
C : we may not
C : some other  later,  I mean
C : you know all this can  done.
C : Yeah.
A : i-
B : Well, X_Waves  well,  pretty  level.
B : for phoneme-level
B : Although, they actually  nice  tool for -
B : that could be used for speaker  marking.
C : There's a - there are - there's a whole  bunch  of tools. There's a - some web
C : No, no, no. There's some  -
C : a lot of @@  these things.
D : There are two  projects, which
D : huge  focused  on this kind of thing,
D : One of them's MATE,
D : one of them's EAGLES.
C : Oh, EAGLES.
C : Yeah, that's the European  one.
D : And both  of them have -
D : I think you got it as a prize
D : Got a surprise.
D : you know, a lot  of -
D : being run out of Denmark
D : a work  bench or something or other. And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them.
D : So, I mean, there are  things that
D : in terms of like the time  alignment issue
D : I mean, you  that,
D : I mean ,
D : I know for a fact,  across  these,
D : and those  my  first two choices of looking at.
D : And I have  the documentation downstairs.
B : Ha- Have you looked  already?
D : you know, how do you time  align it.
B : Oh. So, these are p- particularly  for time alignment?
D : so they're intended  for this kind of a
D : comp- compu- s- computer science application  type of approach. These are not discourse types of tools.
B : Right.  - are they just for time alignment or are they for
C : You don't - Just take the thing with you.
D : Are you  serious?
B : It's wireless.  I mean it won't -
C : I don't know what will happen,  well.
D : Do I need this? I need my keys.
D : O_K.
D : Oops!
B : Yeah, don't talk
C : Yeah, true.
C : You can  want.
C : I-
B : For the digits  -
C : So they probably will  have tools to address the actual
D : Oops.
C : the - the - the transcriber  and  then  exactly  the problem we have. So.
A : Right, but we  That's  not a problem
D : O_K
C : But then again we don't have  to do it.
C : and -
B : Well, I'm not sure  not.
B : e- especially in e- with speaker  overlapping  so much, I don't think we're gonna have a -
B : a prayer.
C : Oh sure,  microphones.
B : Oh, that's  these.
B : I hadn't even thought  Sure.
B : In terms of data  formats, uh
B : what I did  Digits  stuff was just
B : to hand-rolled  own.
B : That  form.
B : You know, it's just  something  easy  parse  Perl.
B : Probably  for
B : the full  something  like  M.
B : I mean, some format that our tools already work  with.
C : although that might @@
C : we'll have several  formats that you can interconvert between.
C : I - I - I've got no  idea
C : what  look  like.
A : Well I know  that -
C : on our speaker phones.
A : I know that um
A : does not  come out in S_T_M format.
A : sentence  information.
B : O_K. "MATE Mark-up  O_K?
C : Right.
D : " Specification   of uh Coding workbench",
B : Oh, no!  L " in it!
C : Oh, good.
C : It must be - It must be fundable  then.
D : "K_C_M file formats",
A : Looks like uh work  packages.
A : Must be project.
C : @@
A : Oh, so they're  using the Alembic
A : Workbench,  from Mitre.
A : I guess.
D : And I'll try to get one for you, too.
D : Oh, you've got  one.
D : He's got the Mark-up  Framework.
B : But it doesn't have enough pictures.
B : it will require too much reading  to understand whether this is anything
D : These things do  seem to be -
B : "T_E_I" is - ?
D : so, you know, but focus  tools  do  this stuff
B : Well, I guess  X_M_L
B : makes some  sense.  I'm  familiar  with it but
B : that this would be good  for.
D : Well, yeah, I mean, if you start  with a -
D : and a good filter.
D : sort of my  feeling about it, that you should be -
D : you should be able to translate  between
D : at least,  discourse,  mostly.
D : This - this  here  Stuttgart  -
D : um - I wanted to mention this  you.  I was
D : Because he's  represent  -
C : I don't  think  so.
D : It either means uh "himself" or it means " even "
D : and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation.
D : can locate  uh
D : intonational  tags.
D : Anyway,  that.
D : I have one  more thing I need to find.
C : Well.
A : But that  kind of thing
A : I think we would probably want to extract  automatically.
D : Oh. O_K.
A : She's  going to be the one who's the most
A : And so   she  may have some ideas.
B : Right, but it's - I think for the initial  task,
B : just getting the word transcripts and speaker  change
B : is highest  my  list.
D : the t- the type   -
D : tools  and things and um
D : There's this  one
D : This is called " Transcriber ".
D : "binary distribution for - for
D : S_G_I and Windows ".
D : "Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech
D : to manually segment, label and transcribe speech  signals"
C : I think  heard  Renals
D : It is  possible.
B : Well I think  that uh -
B : It sounds  little  tools,  Jane, so
B : Are y- Do you feel comfortable just picking  one?
D : I've never used any  of them.
D : uh together  with, in terms of
D : Here's another  thing I got.
A : probably  C  transcription  C.
A : I  contacts  at the L_D_C what -
A : what it is  use.
D : Oh! Good  idea.
D : Great  idea.
D : Excellent
D : "Automatic annotation of prosody in Verbmobil.
D : This is the other  um - This is part of EAGLES, but
D : Why  whispering?
B : Well, so, how  proceed  picking  tool?
B : Jane, do you want to pick  few  download  them and
B : try  out?
D : I think that would be lovely.
D : uh simply  word
C : Well -
C : We are  going to do time alignment.
C : but we'll probably do it ourselves,  right?
C : So we're not - we're not concerned  about getting - getting -
C : bringing in  tools.
C : We're not  very good but we're
C : proud  of ourselves.
C : We're very proud  of our time alignment.
B : but, in terms of what the transcriber  needs to do,
D : Oh  O_K .
B : maybe for word- speaker  change, but -
C : Um.
C : That's a had some involvement with.
B : O_K , then we'll have to use it.
C : If I have to use it I'm sure  sure  -
C : It's a T_C_L-based thing. I'm sure it's just wonderful.

A : that - that we shouldn't discuss this now,  but I'm -
D : Oh, not right now, but I mean in the future.  So at this meeting with Liz
D : I - I do  -
A : Well,
B : almost  none  right now,
B : We need to move forward  there.
B : But uh, yeah,  I  K.
B : there's also  general  channels  or should we just -
B : Dan and I spoke about this briefly,
B : do we want to try to combine  channels somehow
B : to make the transcriber's job easier?
B : I was listening  to some of it and uh
B : like, if you just  listen  far
B : P_Z_ M
B : the person sitting at this  all.
B : try a little  bit
B : to combine  the channels.
C : Uh, the stuff I  stereo.
B : Oh, so, that  would be
B : interesting as well  to do that.
B : this  one -
B : the two  separated  Ms  -
B : Well,  maybe, maybe not.
C : But I mean - But you would - you would - You know, you'd get
C : You'd get good pick  table.
B : O_K, do we have anything  transcribes?
C : We're going to end up with some  -
C : I mean, ultimately,  we're going to end up with
C : transcriptions  meetings.
B : Well, that's my  interest.
B : I mean, other  interests,  so.
B : That's what I  want.
C : uh, far-field mikes cuz what we - that's the problem we're trying to solve.
B : so, the reason  well  work  we wanna back-

D : there
C : Yeah. Yeah. Close mikes.
D : O_K.
C : that - What we're actually going to do  with these data is
C : very  unclear to me
C : Well, because I don't  think that's a -

B : Well, but you know we have to try.
B : We - we - we could simply  not  do  project.
B : But I think that's a bad  solution.
A : We also  need to d-

B : Oh,  know  that.
D : You know, if - if we were to add addition,
D : and I'm offering  this,
D : to the word  level,

B : Well, I think  some  extent with things like
B : the stress  and the other prosodic
B : things an- and tighter  time  do
B : we should probably  do  those
B : but only  once we have a consumer of that data
B : You know, so right  have  consumer  of
B : the word  transcripts and the
B : speaker  Me.  want  those things to work.
B : And so I would like  possible.
B : And so, if -
B : if Liz  else  to do some work on
B : prosody  stress  and so on
B : we can go back  to the data and generate the
D : it really is  just as easy to put the stress in at that point.
D : because I do  words  -
D : You know of course, Rosaria's
D : pursuing this - this area
D : but I really  do  think
D : from everything  I've  run across that um
D : you should  gain
D : I mean I don't know how - how reliable Lea  is,
D : but this idea of islands of - of um
D : The stressed w- stressed  words.
D : uh words that get stressed
C : I  see.
D : I think it c- there's be sort of a benefit  very  minimal  input.

D : and why the heck not  in  word  level? So -
D : the part that I'm  supply  that without any -
D : it's just - it's there.

D : these near  mikes?
B : We have five  wireless.
B : going to be getting  bunch  wired  well.
B : your - you  you  walked  around.  None  rest  of us have.
B : And so we could have wired  mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal.
D : Oh, I  see.
B : for bigger  meetings.
B : It really makes you feel like you're doing real  work
B : when you get all this hardware.
D : and they do  DAT  recorders,
C : If we can do  anything with it, yeah.

D : My normal  s-.
D : I don't know  why.
