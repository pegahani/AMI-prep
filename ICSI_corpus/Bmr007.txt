D : as usual,
D : anything goes beyond that.
F : O_K, it's - it's very
F : eh - it's
F : basically  the same.
F : But, same idea. So, if you've looked at this you've seen it before, so um
F : as you know, uh
F : part of the encoding
F : an overlap.
F : It's not indicated
F : with, um precision,  it's just indicated that -
F : what  parts of sp-
F : which - which stretches of speech were in the clear,
F : used this mark and, um
F : uh,
F : divided the -
F : I wrote a script
F : which divides things into individual minutes,
F : five, and a little bit.
F : And, uh
F : you know, minute zero, of course, is the first minute up to
F : sixty seconds.
C : O_K
F : And, um
F : and then
F : to the right,
F : two  three  more  than three speakers.
F : And,
F : and,
F : what I was looking for sp- sp- specifically was  the question of
F : evenly  throughout or whether they're
F : bursts  of them.
F : Um.
F : And it looked to me as though -
F : uh, you know - y- this is just -
F : not  statistically
F : verified,
F : but it
F : did  throughout,  rather than being
F : localized to a particular region.
F : The part  maximum  number of -
F : overlaps is an area where we were discussing
F : whether or not it would be useful to indi- to s- to
F : code
F : stress,
F : sentence  stress
F : information  retrieval.
F : So it's like,
F : you know, rather,
F : lively discussion there.
D : What was - what's the - the parenthesized  that says, like -
D : e-  six  two  point eight?
F : cent.
D : Mmm.
F : six  session.
F : you know, packing up to go basically, there's
F : final  stuff, I think we -
F : where  fell. I'd have to look at that. But
F : the final three there are no overlaps at all.
F : are not. So, i- it seems like it goes through bursts
F : that's kind of it. Now,
F : Another  question is
F : is there - are there
F : be  with  others.
F : And, again particular
F : um -
F : testing  of it all, but
F : I, um
F : I took the coding of
F : the - I, you know, my - I had this script
F : figure out, um
F : who
F : was the first speaker, who was the second speaker involved in a two-person overlap, I didn't look at the ones involving three or more.
F : And, um
F : this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of
F : who tended to be overlapping most often with who -
F : marginal  totals, which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom, you get
F : individual.  So,
F : If you
F : bottom,  those are the, um
F : numbers of overlaps in which
F : Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look -
F : I'm sorry, but you're o- alphabetical, that's why I'm choosing you
F : And then if you look across the right,
F : that's where he was the
F : speaker  in the pair
F : and got overlap-
F : overlapped  with by somebody.
F : And, summary  table,
F : then you see that, um
F : th- they're differences in
F : with  or
F : overlapped
H : Is this uh counts  or is it -
F : by.
H : how much each person spoke.
F : very  it would be good to normalize with respect to that. Now on the table I did
F : away  from the raw frequencies by putting,
F : percentages.  So that the percentage of time
F : of the - of the times that a person spoke,
F : what percentage
F : eh, w- so.
F : Of the times a person spoke and  furthermore was involved in a two- two-person overlap,
F : overlapper  overlappee?
F : And there,  differences,
F : um,
F : that some people tend to be overlapped
F : with  overlapped,  but, of course,
F : uh i- e- one  meeting,
F : no  statistical testing involved, and that would be
F : finding  kind of
D : S- so, i- it would be statistically  incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something.
F : reliability.
H : No - no actually, that would be actually  correct,
F : No, no, no.
E : Yeah, yeah.
F : you know, I'm - I don't see a point of singling people out,
F : now, this  is a case where obviously -
D : B- I - I - I  enjoyed  this
F : you know, it's like - I'm not - I'm not
H : Yes, that's right, so you don't nee- O_K.
F : I don't think that it's - I
F : and - and, so, might as well do this.
H : This is actually - when Jane sent this email first,  thinking  about
H : anonymizing  data.
F : Well, fair enough. Fair enough.
F : not  tendencies toward
F : styles,  different speaker styles.
D : Oh  sure.
F : And
F : was  this, and w- what were they, and
F : i- and I - and I know  that I can distinguish at least three types and, probably more, I mean, the
F : general
F : conversation  seventies  strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th- before you start talking, and
F : and you know, I mean,
F : w- we know that -
F : an- and they've loosened up on that too s- in the intervening time, that
F : that that's - that's
F : relative  Coast  where people
F : often  interest  saying.
H : Uh-huh.
F : And
F : exactly!  Well, there you go. Fine, that's alright, that's O_K.
B : Exactly!
E : Yeah
F : styles,  and it's um
F : impose  a model of -
F : there - of the ideal being no overlaps, and
F : also  agree with that, so it's
F : now, universally
F : agreed  with.
F : I can't say  universally,
F : now, uh
F : don't.  also
F : uh,
F : sub- of subcultural norms and
F : cross-cultural norms and things.
F : So, um
F : um types  I  noticed. So,
F : um, anticipating the end of a question
F : and simply answering it earlier, and there are several of those in this - in these data where -
F : because we're
F : people who've talked to each other,
F : we know

F : ev- even more sp- specific  than that.
F : thing  and that it would be im-
F : i- useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved.

E : With eh fricative  new  study .
D : go ahead .
G : You split this by minute, um so if an overlap
G : straddles both  of those minutes.
F : Actually, um
F : um not.
F : Uh, so le- let's think about the case where
F : and then the minute boundary happens.
F : And let's say that
F : after that minute boundary,
F : B_ is still speaking,
F : and A_ overlaps
F : with B_,
F : that would be a new overlap.
F : otherwise
F : um, let's say B_
F : comes to the conclusion of - of that turn without
F : anyone overlapping with him or her,

G : both a - a portion  of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two.

D : you start talking and I start talking
D : and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds.
D : So we go over - So we were - we were talking  over one another,
D : and it's just -
D : in each  interval.
D : So, um over  the minute boundary.
D : Is this done  this.
F : No,  wouldn't.

D : good,  meant  the question, right?
B : That's - that's good, yeah, cuz the overall rate is -

F : Because the idea was the first  speaker
F : had the floor
F : second  person
H : Cuz i- i- I find it interesting  overlaps  all  two-speaker.
H : I mean what I thought  - what I
H : would have thought  in
H : large  overlaps,  everyone  once,
F : That's  interesting.
H : apparently not.  neat.
D : Yeah.
H : This
F : is.  I think so too, I think -
B : I think  what's really interesting though, it is
B : before d-
B : yes,  overlaps " is to actually
B : find out how  more
B : two-party.
B : Cuz in two-party  Switchboard,  awful  lot too if you just look at
B : backchannels,  if you consider those overlaps?
B : it's also ver- it's huge.
B : looking  single-channel  processing for
B : speech  recognition.
B : have
B : two-person  people.
B : to a meeting,
B : may  be a lot more but i- it may -
B : not  be.
D : Well, but see, I find it interesting even if it wasn't  any more,
D : were  out
D : nice,  so that - so the issue is in - in a situation
B : not  nice ".
D : where th- that's -
B : It depends what you're doing.
B : having, uh -
B : depends what you're doing,
B : Right now we're do- we have individual   mikes on the people in this meeting.
B : "are there really more overlaps happening
B : than there would be in a two-person  party ".
B : And - and there well may be,  but -
D : I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that's too - i- too imprecise.
D : But what I mean  is
D : that, um in  Switchboard,
D : many  not  considering is overlap.
D : And what we're doing now  is,
D : other  task,  are  considering overlap
D : one  considering  it,
D : one  of them
D : not all  one  is
D : I'm  very interested in
D : audible,
D : microphone.
D : does  get mixed in,
D : and it's pretty hard to jus-
D : ignore  one  other.
B : also  Switchboard  and if you
B : think of meetings
B : being recorded over the telephone, which I think,
B : you know, this whole  point  studying  meetings  room  but to also have
B : meetings  phone  lines.
B : Maybe far field mike  dialogue  issues still apply,
B : that  way
B : conference  call.
B : Switchboard
B : think  simplest  case  meeting
B : wondering  overlap
B : of
B : described  people  present.
B : So it may be that having three  people
B : very  not  be.
D : That's an important  question to ask. I think what I'm -
D : considering  that in Switchboard.
B : Not you, me.
H : Though it wasn't in  design.
D : I mean, w- w- were -
B : so, from the point of view of studying dialogue,  Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on,
B : you want to know the sequence  of turns.
B : So what happens is if you're  talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn,
B : what it looks  your  backchannel,
B : even though my backchannel occurred completely inside  your turn.
B : We know  wrong
B : But, because
B : the acoustic  segmentations  some  Switchboard  missing,
B : people couldn't study  it,
B : world  talk  that way.
D : Yeah, I wasn't saying  that.
D : Right? I was just saying that w- now  looking  at it.
D : And - and - and, you - you maybe wanted  data  weren't.
B : Right. We're looking  here.
D : So that's why it's coming to us as new
D : be
D : you know, if your - if your hypothes- The hypothesis you were offering
D : eh - Right? -
D : if it's the null  hypothesis,
D : and if actually you have as much  overlap in a two-person,
D : we don't  answer  to that.
D : The reason we don't  answer  studied
D : and it wasn't studied  up.  Right?
B : meeting,
B : studying meetings  people  versus
B : what
B : kinds of questions you could ask with a two-person  meeting.
B : It's important   to distinguish
B : that, you know, this project
B : is getting a lot of overlap
B : other  projects were too,
B : but we just couldn't study  them.
D : May
B : And and so uh
D : May  have been. Right?
B : there is  rate,
B : So.
B : It's - but I don't know how  high,
A : I  have a question.
D : I mean, my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody, " what  overlaps  here?"
D : what we've learned about is overlaps  in this situation, is that - the first -
D : first-order  lot  of them.
D : common sense  notion of
D : how - how much people overlap.
D : Uh you know the fact that when - when - when, uh, Adam was looking for a stretch of - of speech before, that didn't have any overlaps, and he w- he was having such a hard time
D : and now I look at this  see  happening  lot.
B : That's also true of Switchboard.
D : I wasn't saying it wasn't.
B : Right.  So it's just,
D : I was commenting about this.
D : I'm saying if I  -
D : have  front  of me,
D : and we sh- which, you know we're gonna get
D : much  lots  data,
D : analyzed  first-order  thing  lot  overlaps ".
D : not  just an overlap -
D : bunch of overlaps - second-order  thing is
D : it's not  one  point,
D : but that there's overlaps, uh throughout  the thing.
D : And that's interesting.  That's  all.
B : reason  number  of people in the meeting.
D : Oh yeah.
D : Yeah, I wasn't making any statement  that.
B : And - and it would actually be interesting to find out  because
B : data say Switchboard, which isn't exactly the same kind of context, I mean these are two people who don't  know each other and so forth,
B : But we should still  be able to
B : somehow
B : say what - what is the added   contra- contribution to sort of overlap
H : Yep. I could certainly  see  either  way.
F : O_K, now.
F : Wh- yeah, I - I agree - I agree with Adam. And the reason is because I think there's a limit -
F : bound
F : simply
F : audibility.  speak  do  make a judgment of
F : "can -"
F : you know, as adults.  adjust  so well,
F : I mean, if a truck
F : adults will
F : well, depending, but mostly,  adults will - will -
F : will hold off to what -
F : noise  do
F : monitor  things like that,
F : about - whether we - whether our utterance will be in the clear or not.
F : rhythmic  structure in conversation, so,
F : you know, you - you t-
F : people tend  time  their - their -
F : their, um
F : uh
F : don't  want to be c- cross-cutting.

F : backchannels,
F : that
F : intention  of being heard,
F : backchannels,
F : in which case
F : those  might -
F : there may be no  those.
G : I - I have a feeling  that backchannels, which are
G : the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard,
G : here,  unnatural
B : If you can see  them, actually.
B : Right  here,  but
G : but, it's sort of odd if one person's speaking and everybody's listening, and
D : Actually, I  think I've done it
D : fair  @@  But.
B : There's a lot of head-nodding,
B : in this
H : Yep, we need to put trackers  on it.
B : @@
A : In - in the two-person  -
E : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
F : He could,  he could.
G : Yeah. So - so actually, um
G : That's in part because the nodding,  visual  contact,
G : function,  phone,  Switchboard
G : work.  So
G : so you need  backchannel.
H : Your mike is -
A : So, in the two-person  conversations,
A : backchannel,
H : That is  so it's on your ear.
A : overlap
A : in the speech? or -
A : impression  is sometimes
A : it happens when there's a pause,
A : get a lot of backchannel, when somebody's pausing
F : She's  doing that.
B : Sorry, what were you saying?
A : It's hard  to do both, huh?
A : Um
A : no, when - when - when there's backchannel,  I mean, just -
A : I was just listening,  and -
A : and when there's two  backchannel  it seems like,
A : backchannel  happens  pitch  drops and the first person -
A : and a lot  stops
A : and then they start up  again, and so I'm wondering about -
B : I think  lot  Jose
B : I mean, this is called "precision timing" in conversation analysis,
B : they come in
B : but at a point where
B : the
B : complete.
B : technically,  it's an overlap.
A : But maybe a - just a small  overlap?
B : information  the predictable information.
E : More, yeah.
H : It'd be interesting  prediction.
A : I was just thinking more in terms of alignment,
A : alignment  overlap.
H : Language  overlap,  really  interesting.
G : So - so -
B : Well, that's exactly,  exactly  why  we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins- in
B : uh Switchboard,  say, because there's a lot of that.
G : So - so here's  labeling
G : Uh, to distinguish between, say, backchannels
G : you know, benevolent  overlaps,
G : and w- and -
G : and sort of, um hostile  overlaps, where
G : Uh, that  interesting,  problem  look  at.
F : really  had the feeling that wasn't happening, that
F : the hostile - hostile type.
F : These were - these were
F : benevolent types, as people
F : finishing each other's sentences, and
F : stuff.
G : and this is sort of, not hostile,  competitive,
G : one  finishing  something and
G : you have, like, two  three  people jumping - trying to -
H : Trying to get
G : trying to -
G : grab  turn.
G : And so it's not  first
G : waiting  finish.
G : all  next.
D : I have a feeling  most of these things are - that -
D : that are not
D : a benevolent kind are - are
D : um
D : are - are competitive  really  hostile. But.
A : I wonder what determines who gets  the floor?
F : Well, there are various  things, you - you have the -
D : Uh a vote - vote in Florida. Yeah.

G : Seniority.
D : You know, the other  these -
D : all  questions  hard  answer  with, uh u-
D : data.
D : @@
H : Ach.
D : So, um wonder  if what you're saying
D : a smaller  number of people.
D : uh, meetings currently with say five, six, seven, eight people
D : really  have  or some three-person meetings and re- record them
D : beef up the - the statistics  on that?
F : it seems like there are two  possibilities there, I mean
F : i- it seems like
F : if you have just
F : two  people it's not
F : really,
F : y- like a meeting,  w-
F : is not as similar  as the rest of the -
F : sample.
F : It depends on what you're after, of course, but
F : that  control  experimental
F : more  than two.
D : If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals. You wouldn't have that difference also  that you have in the
D : say, in Switchboard  data.
F : Yeah, I'm just thinking that'd be more like a c- control  condition.
H : Well, but from the acoustic  point of view,
D : Yeah, acoustic  is fine, but -
G : If - if the goal were to just  overlap  you would -
G : you could serve yourself - save  time  words.
B : Well, I was thinking you should  be able to do this
B : from the acoustics,  close-talking  mikes, right?
H : Well, that's - the - that was my - my status report, so
B : Right, I mean Adam was -
F : You've been working  on that.
F : Yeah.
B : typology,  obviously, but
H : this  discussing,
D : Do you think that would be useful? I'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two-person meetings or something.
B : I guess my - my first comment was, um only that
B : we should n- not attribute overlaps  only to meetings, but maybe that's obvious, maybe
B : look at are  these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned, that
B : what maybe the additional  right  after a turn,
B : you know, because now you can have five  people trying to grab the turn, but pretty quickly
B : there're - they back off  and you go back to this sort of
B : So, I don't know. To answer your question I it - I don't think it's
B : controls but I think it's worth recording all the meetings we
H : Can.
B : can.
D : Well, O_K.
B : So, um
G : I  I  have an idea.
B : D- I wouldn't not  record a two-person meeting just because it only has two people.
G : we have - have in the past  continue  continue  phone  conference calls.
H : Yeah, we talked
G : And,
G : and as a -
G : as another c- comparison  we could
G : what happens  overlap,  don't  have visual contact.
H : It just seems like that's a very different  thing than what we're doing.
B : I mean physically  record  the o- the other -
D : Well, we'll have to set up  for it.
D : to do that.
G : Or,
G : this is getting a little extravagant,
G : blinds  or something to -
H : Barriers!
G : to remove, uh
B : That's what they did  on Map Task,
G : contact.
D : Well, we - we record this meeting so regularly  it wouldn't be that -
D : I mean strange.
H : O_K, we can record,  no  look  at each other.
B : Well, we could just put blindfolds  on.
H : Close  your eyes.
H : Turn off the lights.
D : Oh, th- that  other  thing, weren't we gonna take a picture
D : at the beginning of each of these meetings?
H : thought  whiteboards.
H : rather than take pictures of the meeting.
D : Yes.
D : There's a head nodding here vigorously, yeah.
F : also take a picture of the meeting.
B : Ee- you mean, transc-
E : @@
F : because you get then the spatial  speakers.
G : Well, you could do that by just noting  enrollment  sheet the -
F : And that
F : could be
H : Seat  number, that's a good idea.
G : seat  number.
E : Yeah. Is possible to get information from the rhythmic  ge-  uh, files.
G : So you'd number  them somehow.
H : I finally  remembered to put, uh
A : We can - can't you figure it out from the mike  number?
H : put native language on the newer  forms.
H : The wireless  ones.
H : And even the jacks,  in front of you.
B : But probably  infer it.
H : It would be another task.
H : Having - having ground tu- truth would be nice,  seat  number would be good.
A : Beam-forming  digit  uh stuff.
H : So I'm gonna put little labels  chairs  seat  number. That's a good idea.
G : Not the chairs.  chairs  are -
G : Chairs  movable.
G : Put them -
E : The chair-
G : Like, table  where they -
F : the linguistic anthropologists  anyway,  because you get
A : Just  joke.
F : posture.
G : What people were wearing.
F : you know,
F : face  or whatever but -
F : these  important  cues, I mean the -
G : Oh, Andreas  was -
A : How big their heads
F : how a person is sitting is -
G : Andreas  wearing  same  sweater  again.
F : It'd be better than nothing,  is - is -
F : i- Just from a single  some  aspects.
F : I mean I - I could tell  meetings  I notice that there are certain people who
G : Morgan  funny  hair  again.
F : Yeah.
F : Well, I mean you black out the - that  part. But it's just, you know, the - the body
A : He agreed.
H : Of course, the - where  table,  very  interesting,  to
H : gravitate  same  place  time.
H : and it's somewhat  coincidental.  here  so that I can
H : run into the room  hardware  catching  fire  something.
G : Oh, no, you - you just like to be in charge,  that's why you're sitting -
H : I just want to be at the head  table.
D : Speaking  control,  to talk about .
H : uh, using the close-talking  try  speaking.
H : So my first  filtering,  that we talked about - about two weeks ago,
H : it works O_ K,  except that
H : very  sensitive to your choice of
H : threshold.
H : But if you try to use the same parameters on another speaker,  even if you normalize it based on
H : the absolute loudness.
B : But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting?
H : It does  work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting.
H : Pretty  Pretty  well.
H : How  do  it? What do you mean?
H : So there was a minimum  run length, so that -
A : Every frame that's over what  threshold?
H : A threshold  pick.
A : In terms of energy?
H : So you take a - each frame, and you compute the energy and if it's over the threshold you set it to one,  zero,
H : so now you have a bit  of zeros and ones.
H : And then I median  filtered  that
H : using, um filter length.
H : Uh long,  you know, tenth of a second sorts of numbers.
H : you know, pitch,
H : you know, the pitch  contours,
H : And that works O_ K,  how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds.
A : Did you ever try running the filter before  you pick a threshold?
H : I had  mostly  already  easy  do.
H : O_K and then the other  thing I did, was I took
H : Javier's speaker-change  change  that  mikes,
H : unfortunately  that's not working real well, and it looks like it's -
H : candidate  places to do a break.
H : And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone  classification and he
H : the, uh one  of the phone classes is silence.
H : And so the possible  breaks  silence  starts and ends.
H : second  pass which is a modeling - a Gaussian mixture model.
H : whether it improves  degrades  at  one of those particular places.
H : And what looks like it's happening  is that the -
H : even on the close-talking  mike
A : Who  trained  on?
H : Um
H : So, at any rate, my next  midst  of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the
H : uh, thresholding
H : Because one of the things that definitely  happens  put  low  lots  of breaks.
H : All  definitely  acoustic events.
H : They're definitely
H : someone  talking.
H : But, like, it could be someone who isn't the person here,  there  breathing.
H : that  into the acoustic change detector.
H : And so I think that  work.
H : But all  of this is close-talking mike, so
H : just  trying to get some ground truth.
E : Only with eh
E : when - when, y- I - talker. I - I think the
H : Oh, absolutely.  intention  this  is  aide  truth.
E : Um
E : I - I - I mean that eh eh in the - in the mixed file
E : you can find, uh
E : great different, eh level of energy.
E : Um
E : I - I think for, eh algorithm based  on energy,
E : eh, that um
E : h- mmm, - more or less, eh, like eh
E : When y- you the detect the - the - the first at - at the end  of - of the
E : detector of, ehm princ- um. What is the - the name in English ? the - the, mmm,
E : in - in the background
H : I'm - I'm not sure what you're saying,  can you try -
E : I mean that when - when you use, eh any
A : I think he's saying the onset  detector.
E : I - I think it's probably to work  great  level of energy.
E : eh sp-
E : Because the signal is, eh
E : in - in that, eh more similar.
E : between the different eh, speaker,
H : But different speakers.
E : I - I think is - eh, it will more difficult to - to detect
E : bass-tone  energy.
E : the - the change.
E : I think that, um Yeah. And the - the another question, that when
H : Ah, in the clo- in the P_D_ A,  question.  much  Much  harder.
E : I review the - the - the work of Javier. I think the, nnn, the, nnn, neural network
E : to - to get a broad class of phonetic, eh from, eh uh
E : If you have, eh
E : uh, I'm considering, only because Javier, eh nnn,
E : the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker,
E : eh between each phoneme.
H : Yeah, when a phone  changes.
E : Because, I - I - I think it's more realistic that, uh exists
E : eh
E : is - is, eh
E : I - I found that the, eh eh, two speakers together
E : without enough silence between - between them
E : eh is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I - I - I
E : I_X or, mmm, BIC   criterion for consider all the frames
D : just used silence
D : was not because he thought it was better,
D : it was - it was - it was the place he was starting.
D : your  case, if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to
H : Do  something.
D : But his - his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also.
E : But, eh do - do you think that if you consider all the frames
E : the - the, eh
E : BIC   criterion
E : to detect the - the - the different acoustic change, eh
E : a general, eh
E : eh
E : An- and then, eh
E : eh you can consider the energy
E : This - this  BIC   distance  the hypothesis
E : to the - this
E : po-  process
E : Because, eh eh, probably you - you can find the - the
E : eh
E : Less than, ene-  bass-tone  energy to - to consider that, eh
E : that, eh zone.
E : of s- a small silence between speaker, or
E : another algorithm to - to process, the - the segment between marks
E : eh founded by the - the
E : the BIC
E : the speech recognizer with a broad class or - or narrow class, because, in my opinion
E : eh eh
E : adapt
E : the neural net, eh used by Javier with a mixed file.
H : With the what  file?
E : With a m- mixed  file,
E : mix. Sorry.
E : and then you - you, eh
E : you try to - to apply that, eh, eh, eh, speech recognizer to that signal, to the P_D_A, eh I -
E : you will have problems, because the - the - the - the you - you will need t- t- I - I suppose that you will need to -
D : Well, I -
H : Oh, absolutely.  This is - this is not what I was suggesting to do.
D : Look, I - I think this is a -
D : It's a - I used to work, like  kind of thing.
D : have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing, and they work on it for a couple months,
D : Then you say, "O_K, I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate."
D : Then it gets really  hard no matter what you do.
D : I have these other  here,
D : learn  things from, either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever."
D : don't  use any of those things. You say you have
D : looked for acoustic change. Well, what does that mean?
D : That - that means you set some thresholds  somewhere or something, right?
D : and - and so thresholds  from?
D : From something that you looked  at. So
D : always  new  data
D : um
D : And I think that's a problem
H : Well, also what I'm  not  intended  mikes.  I'm  doing
H : is trying to use the close-talking  mike
E : Yeah!
A : You have candidates.
H : Can-  try  first  pass  sort  works.
G : actually - actually -
A : to make marking  easier.
H : haven't  time  intending  to spend a lot of time on it.
H : So.
G : um, I, unfortunately, have to run, but, um
G : I can imagine um
G : that
G : takes into account far-field  and the
G : uh not  close-talking  speaker,  all  of th-
G : all  of the speakers.
G : um
G : If you model  the -
G : effect that
G : me  speaking has on
G : well  as on that,
G : build a -
G : as a state  possible  speaker  combinations
H : Two to the N_ .
H : Two to the number of people in the meeting.
D : But -
H : Anyway.
D : Actually, Andreas may- maybe - maybe just something simpler  but - but
D : um, mike  mike  mixers where, you know, t- in order to able to turn up the gain,
E : Yeah
D : can,  you -
D : you - you lower  talking,  right?
D : And then he had some sort of
D : reasonable way of doing
D : uh, what if you were just looking at very simple  like  don't  threshold  overall  in  microphones.
H : I was thinking  originally  to find out
H : who's  loudest,
H : that  certainly  talking.
H : But I also  threshold  overlap.
E : I - I
E : I analyzed the - the speech files from the, I found zones
H : put your name in.
A : But he's  read  that.
E : including.
E : because, eh to, eh, to get
E : and then, if you consider energy to - to detect overlapping
E : in - in, uh, and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals. The mixed signals, eh.
E : I - I think it's - it's difficult, um en-  with energy to - to consider that in that zone
D : just when he - when Andreas raised  other  information to be gained from looking at all
D : of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated
D : because if there's -
D : if most  of the overlaps -
D : you know, this doesn't cover, say, three,  most  two,
D : if the distribution looks like there's a couple  high  low,  there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures.
D : Uh, by the way, I had an idea with - while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things, is that we can all wear little bells on our heads,
D : so that
E : Yeah.
F : "Ding".
B : I think that'd be really interesting too,  with blindfolds.
H : Nodding with blindfolds, "what are you nodding  about?"
B : Yeah.  whether -
B : one  @@ , like.
A : Actually, I  bus  cell  phone
A : speaking Japanese, and was bowing.
E : Yeah
A : you know, profusely.
F : Ah.
B : You know, if you watch people they'll actually do  these things. So.
B : I still think we should try a - a meeting or two with the blindfolds, at least  of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of
B : Um, maybe for part  whole  meeting.
D : I think it's a great  idea.
B : you know, I can see Chuck  here.
H : Well, we could just  lights.
F : Actually well also -
F : I - I can say I made  barr- barriers for -
F : the Collin  wha-
F : just used, um
F : kind of foam board.
F : R- really
B : But then we also  these  mikes, is the other thing I was thinking, so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb
B : sound,
F : It's true, it would disturb the, um the -
B : um
D : Blindfolds  would be good.
D : Probably we should wait until after Adam's set up the mikes,
B : you know it's -
B : Be interesting to have the camera going.
A : I'll  peeking.
F : form.
H : Yeah, that's right,  tell  blindfolding.
F : blindfolded  while you're interviewed?"
D : that's - that's - that's the one that we videotape.
D : Uh
D : I did  @@  couple  folks,
D : So this is the things that I think  we did
D : obviously not everything  highlights  that I can -
D : outside  working  on.
D : Um in no particular order
D : uh, one,  meetings  recorded,
D : you know from - from, uh
D : Uh
D : sent to I_B_M.
D : uh next batch of recorded data put together on the C_D-ROMs for shipment to I_B_M,
H : Hasn't  sent  but  -
D : yeah, that's why I phrased  it that way,
D : yeah O_K.
D : Um
D : uh and release forms worked out so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of
D : audio pixelization software written and tested.
D : Um
D : and exploratory   analysis of long-distance inferences for topic coherence, that was - I was -
D : sure  if those were the right way -
D : describe  that because of that little exercise that -
D : that you and - and Lokendra did.
F : say again?
D : I - well, I- I'm probably saying  this wrong, but what I said was exploratory analysis of long-distance inferences
D : Something  like that.
D : Um
D : I -
H : I - I did a bunch  stuff  supporting  digits.
D : "Bunch of stuff for s-" O_K, maybe - maybe send me a sentence  that's a little thought through about that.
H : So, O_K, I'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say "a bunch of"?
D : " stuff " is probably bad too,
H : "Stuff" is not very technical.
D : Yeah, well.
H : I'll try to
H : phrase it in passive voice.
A : Technical  stuff.
D : " range  things ",
D : Um
D : what you  Jane
D : Thilo, can you tell us about all the work you've  last three months? That's -
C : Um.
C : Um, I didn't get it. Wh- what is "audio pixelization"?
D : Uh, audio pix- wh- he did  explain  it quickly?
H : It's just, uh beeping  out parts that you don't want included in the meeting so, you know
H : you can say things like, "Well, this should probably  record,  but beep"
D : Yeah. We - we - we spent a - a - a fair amount of time early on just talk- dealing with this issue about op w- e- e-
C : @@
D : way  and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later", and,
D : how do you get around  that so in the consent form it says, well
C : O_K, and you can say -
D : unhappy with, yeah.
C : O_K.
D : uh, well you have to be careful  moment
H : Yeah, you can either beep  silence.  decide.
H : which was the right  Beep  auditorily,
H : listening  to it, there's no mistake that it's been beeped out,
H : software  silence.
A : No,  no. You can - you know, you could make a m-
A : as long as you keep using the same beep,
A : people  model  beep,  and -
F : I like  that idea.
H : And I use - it's - it's, uh
F : It's very  clear.  Then you don't think it's a long pause.
A : Yeah, it's more  obvious  was  there  than if there's just silence.
D : Yeah, that - I mean, he's - he's removing  thing  and - and - and -
A : But I mean if you just replaced it with silence,
A : it's not clear whether that's really silence  or -
C : @@
F : all  channels?
F : Interesting.  like  that.
H : Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's, uh audible.
H : potentially  audible, you could potentially recover it.
H : Well, I - I haven't  thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped. Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then, uh
H : the ar- DARPA meeting.
B : quiet  I am.
H : DARPA  completely,  so it's in a private directory.
B : You have  some  only
F : That's great.
D : Alright, so, uh uh, go on to the digits?
F : I have one concept a- t- I - I want to say,
F : which is that I think it's nice that you're preserving the time  relations,
F : s- so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing scissor
F : the time duration of a - de - deleted - deleted part.
H : Yeah, since we wanna possibly synchronize these things as well.
H : Oh, I should have done  Oh well.
B : bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped, too?
D : before we do the digits, I did also wanna remind people, uh
D : So that, uh, people's ideas don't get yeah, well
B : And, I  interesting
F : Thank  Thank  you.
B : meant  Switchboard  neat.
H : I was gonna say "can you do that for the other meetings, can you do it for them?" And, no  can't.
B : Yeah. Does it take -
F : Thank you.
A : Actually - actually I - I thought that's what you were giving us was another  meeting  and I was like, "Oh, O_K!"
F : Yeah. Aw, thanks.
B : How long does it take, just briefly, like
F : No.
F : I have  script  now, so, I mean, it can work off the, uh
B : t- to -
B : O_K.
H : It's -
B : to label the, O_K.
F : other thing
A : But it has to be hand-labeled  first?
F : Uh, well, yeah.  well, I mean
F : his  - his algorithm is up and running
H : If it works  well enough.
F : then we can do it that  way.
H : Right now it's not.
F : I - I just worked off of my
D : O_K, go ahead
F : Thanks.
F : Appreciate  that.
H : Not quite  to the point where it works.
F : I think - what I - what this has, uh, caused me - so this discussion
F : caused me to wanna subdivide  backchannels, how much we have
H : Yeah, my - my algorithm worked great  these,
H : that  or with the
H : uh, lapel
H : very  face,  failing.
B : I mean if you -
H : I mean, we want  work,  right?
H : change  the way we do the meeting.
A : It's too late now.
B : I feel like this troublemaker.
H : It's uh -
H : comment  software,  not a comment on
H : prescriptions on how you wear microphones.
