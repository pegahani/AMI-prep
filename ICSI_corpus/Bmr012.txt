B : Let's see, I should be
B : Two. La
D : Oh it was.
A : By the way, there was a bug. Yeah, i- it wasn't using the proper
D : Oh. Oh that's interesting. So why didn't you get the same results and the unadapted?
H : It's not always possible.
G : I could - can this be adjuste- like this? Is that @@ ? O_K, thank you.
A : Basically there were no counts @@
H : Yeah. O_K.
C : Uh oh.
C : No I- yeah, yeah, you're channel B_. So can you talk a bit? I thought it might be too O_K.
E : I - I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region,
C : A- actually, wait a minute, shouldn't it be the other way around?
D : Not for me.
C : On the other side, yeah.
A : Well the thing is, if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that -
C : W- we don't care how they - old they really are.
G : Yes.
C : I still don't see the problem.
C : If you have the date @@ .
F : Do you want this Adam?
A : O_K.
C : and um you know separated - used the individual channels we segmented it in- into the segments that Jane had used
C : um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that - that's twenty minutes or so?
A : reference was always one off with the - it was actually recognized so
C : Yeah so that's what we have but that - that will be completely gone if this synch time problem
C : So here's the actual   copy of the email um
E : yeah yeah "bah"
A : Oh, and -
B : Hmm.
D : It'll get those though.
E : Did you say there's no language for P_Z_M?
E : Maybe we shouldn't say P_Z_M in these meetings.
E : Yeah, that's right, Jimlet.
B : Well, we don't even know what that means, so I
C : so but this is really encouraging because
E : Yeah, that's right.
C : on Switchboard-two data with the Switchboard-one trained - mostly trained recognizer and Switchboard-two   is -
C : and a different topic and they're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard-one so there was @@  so that's great.
E : you - the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but
A : Well that's - those are the only we- ones there are, I mean
C : so that's the on- that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of and I guess Ramana , so a guy at S_R_I said that
C : Like Trent Lott must have been from I  Switchboard was before uh.
B : Good point.
E : And it said a hundred percent male?
A : um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right. Yeah so Yeah. Yes.
C : The j-
G : Oh that's - I'm glad.
E : It got all two genders?
C : Tcl   or T_C_L.
E : That we're starting so well?
D : So the real value of the database is these?
C : Sorry can't remember.
A : uh you know variants of - of - of the recognition runs um certainly doable.
G : so this issue
G : well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the
G : uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects and I don't know how that stands, I mean if you - if you get fantastic results and it's involving data which -
A : is there - are there any um
F : There are lots of w- there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to
E : Resample. Yeah and Dan's archaic acronyms.
E : Not all of them.
C : Some of the vowels, almost all the vowels, that's the hard part.
A : Right and - and it doesn't - is no more work for um
E : I don't think that gives you any information.
C : Well we could try. Could easily try
F : There's - there's your answer.
A : That's what I would assume but you never know, you know.
A : Actually, no. Don't stop. Don't stop at that part because
F : Keep going.
A : shouldn't use - you should s- you know, get @@
G : One - one question which is I - I had the impression from this - from this meeting
B : Which is more that anybody needs so
C : And that's actually said in your meeting, that's how I know that. It's like are we downsampling to sixteen?
G : That's exactly, and that's how I know it.
C : Thank God it's not more than that.
B : Uh but who knows? I mean we do- we - we - we - we - we wanna find all this stuff out, we don't know.
C : Yeah well we could try it.
E : Yeah.
C : Well but he has fewer - he - he won't have more than eight and it's a meeting on even deeper understanding, E_D_U, so that sounds interesting. As a compliment to our front-end meeting
E : Dot E_D_U?
C : or - or put a
B : cuz it is i- you know already we have a - a - a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked
B : Yeah at least w- we got the good ones.
D : Mmm.
C : It's a lot of money for a handband.
C : Is - is there any way we can have you know like a - a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who
F : That's like the Conch.
A : like you know Jerry Springer thing, you know r-
D : Like at conferences
C : and I don't know identifying somehow? You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer.
A : Yeah. @@
D : The Springer mike.
B : Kind of rules out overlap but - but uh
D : Liz hates the lapel.
A : @@
G : also an idea for another meeting, which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data
D : So if we got them to talk about this meeting, it would be a meta - meta meeting.
G : Yeah, exa-
C : It's - they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break and I think that's a good idea, get them involved.
G : yeah that's right.
G : And so but he's only here until
G : until   one and actually we're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon.
D : Do digital ones ?
B : No I don't think it's confusing. Well, it doesn't confuse me.
E : Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that, so.
F : echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps, so.
