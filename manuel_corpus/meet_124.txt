B :  Mm uh .
D :  We're the first .
B :  Mm .
B :  We're the first ones .
D :  Marketing Expert , yes .
A :  Mm .
A :  So you found your spots .
D :  Yes .
B :  Move to the meeting room . Okay .
D :  Bling bling . Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh where has my screen gone ?
C :  Hi .
B :  Hello , good day . Yep .
C :  Oh yeah , we have to talk in English , huh .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . My screen is gone . Oh .
A :  It's called black .
B :  Kick-off meeting , wow .
B :  It's uh looks uh nice .
C :  I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh .
B :  Hmm ?
A :  Okay .
C :  I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . I don't know how much preparation you guys did , but not a lot .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  No , it's it was uh not enough .
A :  You see this beautiful presentation . Okay let's get started .
D :  Yeah . Very nice .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , hope you have good ideas . I don't . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera .
B :  I did my best .
C :  Not yet .
A :  And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
A :  Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
A :  uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Uh well you know how to the documents work . So
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um
A :  we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . Yes . So
C :  Operations .
A :  It doesn't always work .
A :  Yes . Okay so you can
D :  Yeah .
A :  draw .
D :  Draw . Alright .
A :  Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ?
D :  'Kay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal .
A :  Uh you should explain
A :  Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . So , Julian .
B :  Okay .
D :  Don't take up too much space .
B :  Um yeah .
C :  Different pen widths , how do you do that ?
A :  Uh with the format menu .
C :  Oh okay .
A :  And use different colours etcetera .
B :  It's a giraffe . Yeah .
C :  Are you serious ?
A :  And what's that supposed to be ?
D :  Should it be one
A :  Oh yeah . Oh yeah four legs . Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Giraffe's yellow .
B :  Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh
B :  Oh format .
D :  Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or so y you must save it at the end and then
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah . I'll show you . Yeah . In file menu .
B :  That's some spots .
C :  I in the file option menu .
D :  Okay , then m make a new one .
B :  No .
C :  How much time do we have to draw anyway ? 'Cause I can take forever on this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ?
A :  Yeah . What is it ?
B :  I think it's a it's a great animal . It's a it's a giraffe .
A :  A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck but
B :  Yeah , that's a
D :  It's more like a dinosaur .
B :  Um
B :  Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .
A :  Okay . That's nice of you .
D :  Uh .
B :  Hey . Come on .
D :  Some leaf to eat .
B : 
A :  Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh
B :  The next ? Yes .
A :  Okay . Then uh .
D :  Yeah . Thanks .
B :  Here you go . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ?
A :  Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted and
D :  Uh
C :  Alright .
A :  That's the idea , so
C :  Uh . Your line broke .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . It's not that fast . Yeah .
A :  Yeah it's a bit slow , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  I see . It misses the spot .
A :  pressure .
C :  I'm guessing a turtle .
C :  No . I'm kidding .
D :  I say good guess .
D :  Uh
A :  Why a turtle ?
C :  Because of its shell .
D :  Because it's slow . Yeah I was a bit slow too . So
A :  It's slow . You were slow too so
B :  'Cause it's so 'cause it's green .
C :  Dude you're a good drawer .
D :  Uh some other line uh width uh
C :  Do you have a turtle pet ?
D :  No .
C :  Uh okay .
D :  I dunno . Does it have legs ? Yeah ?
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah sure . Yeah not exactly legs but
C :  Stumpy stuff .
A :  More like fins or
D :  It's more like a tank .
D :  Yeah that's fins but I don't know where .
C :  They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Some spots .
D :  Ah some eye .
A :  Yeah it's l looks very friendly .
D :  Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess .
D :  Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough .
A :  Yeah okay .
C :  A little tail maybe .
A : 
D :  Right . I don't know what the position is .
D :  Does it have ears ?
C :  Uh no .
A :  No .
D :  No . Oh okay . Can you erase ears or Yeah ?
B :  No .
C :  The little holes maybe .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah . There's a a gum , gum to .
D :  Alright . Eraser .
C :  And why did you choose this animal ?
D :  So
D :  I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason I pen .
A :  He said it was slow .
C :  Alright .
A :  I like it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well I'm guess I'm done . That's my turtle .
A :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
A :  Your turn Niels .
D :  How to select the next or here .
A :  The next yeah .
D :  Yeah . Here you go .
C :  Colours were under format right ? Let's see . How am I gonna do this ? Um
A :  Makes new paper .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Orange .
C :  Mm uh .
B :  A rabbit I think . Kangaroo .
A :  Kangaroo .
C :  Not quite actually .
B :  Fox .
D :  A fox yeah . Firefox .
A :  Dog .
C :  No . Aye .
A :  Cat .
C :  It's a cat . Not quite yet through .
A :  It's a cat .
B :  Mm .
D :  A cat who had an accident or
A :  Why a cat ?
C :  Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets .
A :  You have some uh ?
C :  Uh I have colour already .
C :  Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit . Um
A :  The pen , yeah .
C :  Excuse my language .
A :  Sure .
C :  I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . That's it . Or do I need to use more colours and
A :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's okay . You get idea right ? Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project . Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh
C :  Alright . Yeah .
A :  the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
A :  And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
C :  So we have to s
A :  Okay now it's time for some discussion .
A : 
B :  Okay . What uh what uh do you want to discuss ?
A :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . We should get started .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  Uh I'm taking notes . Um
D :  Okay . Great .
A :  we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah ? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I guess so . Yeah .
C :  True .
A :  Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
A :  Right ? Yeah ? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or
B :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
C :  well how I have to fill it . Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . And that's basically all I have so far .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
A :  Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
B :  Yeah . Wireless uh huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So that's very common .
B :  Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That are the the basic options for a remote control .
C :  Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh
B :  Okay , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Same I believe .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
D :  Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . I mean , what functions do they have . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? So we can see uh what needs to be supported .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yes .
D :  Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . And you can get that information ?
D :  I think I can get that information , yeah .
A :  Okay . That would be very handy . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
D :  So yeah .
D :  No n not specifically . More to how to get them and
A :  No ?
B :  I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly . Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine .
A :  No okay .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah ?
A :  Of course .
C :  Yeah . Obviously .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Big , mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh and a and a good uh zapping range .
A :  Uh what do you mean by that ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . It has to be capable for zapping uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay um
A :  Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
A :  I think the best is to go to work .
C :  Whoa . Is that you or alright .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Any more points to discuss ?
A :  Yeah . I think
A :  we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
A :  Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email .
D :  Alright .
A :  So that was it for me .
C :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
D :  'Kay . Thanks .
A :  Uh
B :  Are you going to put the the notes on the
A :  Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . I'm writing very fast . Hope it's readable . Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?
D :  Yeah . The pro okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Uh .
B :  Yep .
D :  I guess so .
C :  Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
B :  Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
C :  session ?
A :  Yeah . Because then we have a
B :  After that we are going to the conceptual uh
A :  Yeah . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . I depend on you .
D :  Yeah . We're just working the three phases .
D :  Okay . Better make it
C :  Yeah okay . We'll do our best .
B :  Okay .
C :  I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Do we I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?
A :  Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . That is my question also because like new new functions
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think that is the user
D :  Requirements . Yeah .
A :  requirements part . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small
C :  Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .
D :  Unit .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I would first m
D :  Yeah well I I was
A :  Yeah I understand .
B :  Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah .
D :  Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch
A :  You can always add a few
A :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah records and stuff like that .
A :  Okay .
D :  No .
A :  You need additional yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
D :  In the project uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .
C :  meeting .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't it's yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . I understand . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you're di dismissed . Not yet . Okay .
B :  Can we leave now or
D :  Half an hour .
C :  Thanks .
D :  You're fired . No .
C :  Alright .
B :  Mm .
D :  Alright let's move on .
A :  Let's see what we got to do .
D :  Yeah .
C :  See you later .
D :  Yeah see you later .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Good luck .
A :  Yeah . Thank you .
D :  Well good luck .
C :  What the
