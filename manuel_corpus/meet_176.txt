D :  Funky sh stuff like that .
A :  Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , exactly , yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah . Look at all this stuff man . Okay . Right .
B :  Okay .
B :  So what do we need to talk about ?
C :  Should we
D :  Has anybody
C :  Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing , how far they've got . Well I hope so .
D :  Has anybody done anything ?
A :  Not a lot . No .
A :  Hmm . Okay . Sounds like you've done some stuff . So
B :  Yeah .
D :  You better start .
C :  Okay . Well I've got a browser now , which Whoops . Already gone .
B :  Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Good start . Oh , I don't mind as well . This wasn't a good start .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Good at this .
B :  Okay . Sorry . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  So yeah . We've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics . And then when you go on the menu , you can select a summarisation box , which pops up , and an audio player .
D :  Right .
C :  Um and a s I think the search works as well , so you could pop up a search . And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start , you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that .
C :  Does that make sense ?
C :  Um the transcription box has got a summarise but button , which doesn't do anything yet . Um now I wonder wh how we wanna do , you know , we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation .
C :  Um either we could do that you know , when does the pop-up come ? Either we can when you click on the the I_D_ , any sort of I_D_ in the transcription box , or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box , but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is . The problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um
D :  D yeah .
A :  Hmm .
C :  that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying , you know , the the left-click highlights it . So that you can I don't know what happens when you double-click actually , but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else . Um I think so yeah , when you left-click it , you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there , I think .
D :  The l the left-click or the right-click .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  Can you use double-click or
B :  Yeah , I don't know .
C :  Um so we can't put it on left-click . We could put it on a right-click . We could for example have a little menu that pops up .
D :  Yeah , it might be quite good , I suppose . Yeah .
C :  So right-click on at menu , you know , and you can click on speaker characterisation , up pops the window .
D :  What else could we have in the menu ?
C :  That's a good point . I don't know . Nothing else .
D :  Okay . So otherwise you just have a right-click or do you have have a
A :  Hmm . Everything . Yeah . Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah , but um I don't know about you , but uh usually in Windows right-click doesn't do anything , does it ? It opens a menu . Yeah , so yeah . So but that'd be yeah . If you just yeah .
D :  Is a window .
D :  A menu , yeah yeah . Yeah , it's why . And so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it
B :  And then
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . To just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda . So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Um or just , you know , or just the button .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I guess a button button makes a bit more sense , 'cause otherwise you don't really know that , oh , what if I right-click now , what happens then ? It's like more if it's visual . Yeah .
C :  Well no no , you still have the menu the menu pop up that
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . Yeah . It's more
C :  Well oh , yeah . It's more obvious , isn't it , w what you can do . Yeah . Yeah , that's right . That's true , yeah , it's more intuitive really , isn't it ?
B :  Do you see my
D :  It's more idiot proof , isn't it . It's got a button .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . But then it's not as extensible . Like if we wanna add more things in the future , then we have to well , new buttons . I don't know . Whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way . But We're probably not gonna be adding too many things .
B :  But well , we we can have both , but whatever .
C :  Maybe , maybe .
D :  Add more buttons .
D :  Yeah . Well in uh I guess in in In meeting browser one point one , you can have a menu instead of a button but this why I don't think it Yeah .
A :  Okay , exactly . I know , I know . True , true . Yes .
C :  In the beta version . Um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Like a search for that user . Is that gonna be useful or too much ? Or
D :  Yep .
D :  I guess so . So what did you part of the m the menu that comes down , it says give me all your meetings or something .
C :  Yeah , so y when you right-click on it , one one option will be give me all your meetings , characterise the speaker
D : 
D :  Yep .
C :  Or is that too much I mean ?
B :  Yeah , um I don't I mean it w it's more like part of the
D :  I guess so . It's an idea . Get to use my pen .
B :  browsing sort of thingy . More than the speaker characterisation , as m Steve mentioned . Um , I don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true . It'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like
A :  Actually ,
A :  Yeah , but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well . I mean speaker characterisation tied into I don't know . Di Just some way to sort of leverage that information . Like we have it , we're doing it , but what how does it help the browsing ? Or what can it give us in the browsing ? Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Or you mean the the speaker characterisation ? Oh well , yeah , I mean ,
C :  I don't know about that . I mean it's the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said . I mean it's like a nice thing . We don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it , but it's interesting , so why not give it to him .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah , well
C :  I I think we should do it . I mean
B :  Yeah . I mean I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like , well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic , and then if you , I don't know , click on that topic , you get everything that's in that topic or whatever . And in that way but I don't know .
C :  Yeah , I mean that's that's still another level further . I mean we're not even there yet . You know , it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet . Y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user .
B :  No no no . Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  We have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges . So yeah , there you go .
C :  Yeah . Yes . So should we try try to do a right-click when you then
A :  Yeah . True , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Alright . Why not .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Is that just from the main main window ? Is that is that from any particular window , like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something , have a right-click from for these various things to yeah .
C :  Sorry ?
D :  Even if only one thing comes up .
C :  Yeah . Yes . Wait . Yeah , there's a second thing about the topics , the topic window . We wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that . Yeah ? So we could do that in a similar way , do it right-click as well . And to have a different menu for our
A :  Right , yeah . Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So and so this lot is for um
A :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Now it's consistent throughout . So , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  On the t speaker .
C :  So yeah . So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations . And when then we have the interlinking by right-click basically .
D :  And then this lot is on th
A :  Right .
A :  Actually yeah , like um another common thing , like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu , I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen . If you double-click on a particular topic or something , then it goes to sort of a like a default view , so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic , either whatever we decide the default to be , whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting , and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting . Like I'm just thinking to have the default there , so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen , so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu .
C :  Double-click
C :  Oh .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able , you know , that would be
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well , it might come to us as we start playing with it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  What was that ? I didn't quite understand . Do you mean
A :  Um like we have the the right-click menu . You'll have the menu , right-click it , but instead of like have a default double-click , so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah , exactly . Yeah .
B :  Uh just let th
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click . Oh . Okay .
B :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Like , I don't know , show the speaker characterisation for instance . Or just I don't know .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again . And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is , you know what I mean ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  But if you do double-click on something , don't you expect something to happen then ?
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , maybe . Mm . Hmm .
B :  Sort of well , I don't know .
D :  Sometimes you do it by accident though . You , oh go away . Stop coming up . Yeah . No . Yeah , yeah , oh yeah . T throw stuff throwing out the window .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Especially if you have a touch-pad . It just goes oh . Well I'll I'll check what it does on on um double-click at the moment . 'Cause I think it might do something . But but yeah , mm but I don't I don't I d really don't see anything obvious that that would
A :  Yeah , exactly . Well then they close it . Yeah . You know , it's not it's not the end of the world .
A :  Yeah , . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , uh that was good start .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yep .
C :  I mean if you can think of something that
A :  .
B :  I don't know .
C :  Sorry .
B :  I guess it depends on the
B :  Yeah , what you're clicking on . Obviously .
C :  Sorry . Um yeah , another thing . Single audio files . Do we wanna use them or not ?
A :  Hmm .
D :  We don't know yet do we , I don't think . Do you mean the single channel ?
C :  Yeah , single channel that's single channel files . Do we want them ? I mean
B :  Single channel .
A :  Mm .
D :  Probably not , but we might need them for disfluencies , if we try do it in audio . But at the moment , no . But yeah .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , okay , yeah , yeah . I mean we might use them while wo to work with them , but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's
A :  Well , yeah .
D :  We might want to be able to say oh , just give me what that person's saying .
C :  Do you though ? I mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you ? Does it ?
B :  No .
D :  Unless um you can't hear it properly or something . Somebody's talking over somebody else or something . Well p
D :  W we just say no for now and put it in later or something . Yeah , yeah .
C :  No , hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot , won't it ? Therefore print will be bigger .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um
C :  Yeah , wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned ? Do you think do you think it's really that bad ?
A :  I think we probably need that , though to have the f the full flexibility , we need to have that there , but um yeah .
C :  That's what I feel as well . I mean I'm I'm very much I w I wanna have everything customisable . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Although the thing is typically though , is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time , probably not . Probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at , like dialogue acts , to whatever , characterisations .
C :  Probably not , no . Yeah . Two or three maybe , but yeah . But yeah , it depends , I mean I I really wanna put the summary in somewhere , you know . And the summary for example is typical . You open the window , you read through it , you might click on you know , close it again straight-away . But it'd be good to have it there .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . No , I think it's I think it's fine . Yeah . I think what we're doing is fine .
A :  Yeah , true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But uh well , couldn't we I mean you probably I don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time .
B :  So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary .
A :  Hmm .
A :  So like have a tab there ? For something like that choose on choose one .
C :  I was just thinking of tab .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Tabs are nice . I like tabs . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , tabs are good . Mozilla style . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That true . Yea yeah yeah yeah . That's right . I'm not sure yeah .
B :  I don't know how easy it is . But I dunno , but
D :  Does anybody know how to do that ? Or can you do that in Java ? I don't think Java knows how to do that really . Maybe yeah , you probably can . But but
C :  No . I don't know . Do you reckon ? I'm sure . I'm sure you could do anything .
A :  Oh you should be able to . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  If you really knew what you're doing . But I don't know . It's a bit of a cripple with Java's windowing tool-kit . The eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I can have a look .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Or just , I don't know . Yeah , uh change the contents of the same window , like from transcription to summary .
C :  But yeah , that that might be an idea , yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Probably yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , or even just have buttons on it , toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Just something .
B :  Yeah , yeah . That could probably
A :  A lot of different ways we can do it , it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever . Just gonna be yeah . Yeah .
B :  No , no , it could be like transcription summary , like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want .
A :  Yeah . Exactly .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Or check-marks . Even have two of 'em checked and send Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that will reduce the number of um windows we needed , wouldn't it ? Which is quite good . 'Cause otherwise Photoshop has a lot of windows , if you ever use Photoshop it's got loads , and you're always g forever going no , get out of the way . There's always stuff in the way , isn't there . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I don't like pop-ups .
C :  But I mean people get used to it , I mean when you use a Windows or Linux for that matter , you have a lot of windows open . And you manage them .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You do , yeah ? Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  True .
D :  Yeah . Unless , can you I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that Can you can you do that ? Okay , well it's alright then . Yeah . Of course you can actually , yeah , it's got everything .
B :  I guess that yeah .
C :  Yeah , you can minimise 'em . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Oh yeah ? Okay .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , like a lot of these can be , like once we get the disfluencies out , then we can you know , have transcript without the disfluency , transcript with the disfluent disfluency . Have all these , you know , have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct , yeah . Exclusive , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true , they're they're definitely
C :  Yeah , they're definitely gonna be in the same window , yeah .
B :  He's close .
C :  Exclusive . Yeah , that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway . So d
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , do you wanna do that with summaries in ? Put the summaries in in the same window .
C :  Mutually exclusive with
B :  Yeah , um well could uh I don't know . Would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then . Like full meeting , meeting without disfluencies , and summarise .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Summary . Yeah , you wanna do that ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that kinda makes sense .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , sounds good .
B :  Um yeah .
C :  And finally the prototype he spoke about . What kind of prototype could we produce ?
A :  By the end of February .
C :  Because I'm I'm just , you know , I go into the lab and I say right , what am I gonna change today . You know ? And it kind of just it just develops , I'm not aiming for anything . Do we wanna aim for something ?
A :  Okay , right .
D :  Um
C :  I'm I'm pretty much getting there anyway , to be honest . It's not it's not gonna be a lot more work .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I guess it is . I mean just to try it and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's what we need , yeah . Something just slightly more than just that on its own . Yep .
C :  Oh .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , so we can plug it in and
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo
C :  Mm true .
D :  Yep , definitely .
B :  Um
A :  Hmm .
B :  So I guess that's what we need to aim for .
D :  I think that's kinda as well , isn't it really ? Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh right , I see . Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  a prototype with a GUI .
B :  Yeah . Well if I guess I mean that was probably our intention , but we might not have written it down . So I guess I know .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Actually is the code accessible , like the the GUI stuff that you've done , yeah . Like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory , somewhere ? Or Like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something , try and just plug some stuff I think you can if
C :  Um probably not . I don't know , can you access other people's
D :  You can make it if you make it world readable , then anybody can access it .
A :  Well , if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable , then we c know the directory to get in then and just
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , sure . I don't know if it's readable at the moment , but you can sure have a d have a look .
A :  That might be might be an idea .
A :  Yeah . I think by default they are I think really ? Or
D :  No , uh i i it no , they're not world-readable . It not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default . You can see them but you can't read them .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Alright .
C :  'Kay . Right , well I'll make that readable then . Um so the directory is my number
A :  Okay , alright .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Or you could just email to us . Okay , yeah , yeah , okay , right . Yeah , right , okay .
C :  Well , this is not difficult . It's in all the emails . Not O_ four . O_ four , five five five ,
D :  What's your number ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Yes .
D :  Okay , your number .
D :  Okay .
C :  six O_ .
B :  Say that again , O_ four .
C :  O_ four five five five six O_ .
D :  And then it's
C :  And then um there's a folder um N_L_S_S_D_ ,
D :  N_L_S_S_D_ .
C :  and it's called the M_ browser .
D :  The M_ browser , for meeting .
C :  Yes , M_ for meeting .
A :  Lower case .
D :  Hope you hope you never have to look in my directory . It's just pure chaos . S Mine is serious chaos . Files everywhere .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Really . No , I'm I'm extremely organised , you see . I've got folders for everything . I love folders .
B :  Oh yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yep , so that's me done . Someone else wanna talk about their stuff ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Don't all jump at once .
B :  I could tell you what I done in S_P_ two .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
B :  Oh um I don't know . I basi I s started like browsing a bit , just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  W what where you doing again ?
A :  Um all the searching stuff . Like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that . Hmm .
B :  yeah , searching , yeah well yeah . We're doing the . Yeah , yeah . So it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing , but I haven't read it yet . But
D :  Yeah , what was on it .
C :  The search , okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . So you could probably just use that code , like that was behind the question she asked him earlier . Just You know , the re-using code and stuff was just like okay , good .
C :  Indexing .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh right . Oh that's pretty much there , is it ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh you found some code for it . For the inde
B :  Yeah , well I don't know if it's usable . I uh can have a look th at it . But but I found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing . Uh whatever . Yeah .
A :  Um apparently
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Alright .
C :  Of making
D :  Alright . Cool , cool . So even if it doesn't work , you can jiggery pokery around and make it work . Y yeah .
C :  Oh great .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , probably . We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while , I don't know , creation . Messing around still , though . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah . All sorts of nonsense . But yeah . By the basics is uh oh okay , that's good .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's handy .
A :  Yeah . Um
B :  Um yeah , I guess that's it .
C :  So you think it shouldn't be too difficult ?
B :  I don't know . Uh I'm I was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files . I mean uh how much do we actually need to do . Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing ?
A :  Hmm .
C :  Oh , I see . Yeah . You have to convert it to some sort of format , I suppose .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it . And I can get rid of it , but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else . So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it . But I guess it's not very difficult . Yeah , in Java , yeah .
C : 
A :  Huh ? Okay . Right .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay . What are you writing in Java or yeah , okay . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
B :  you know a bunch about file things .
C :  I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then , because um , you know , they already extract for example transcripts . Put it into a window at least .
D :  Yeah yeah , I'm sure they do . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's good idea .
D :  Yeah . Oh yeah , I will . I'm sure it's nothing difficult . I'm sure I'm making a meal of it at the moment actually .
B :  Um yeah , I guess I mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things . I mean if you already started on on doing your stuff , I guess we can
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Absolutely , yeah .
D :  Should share as much as possible .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm , libraries .
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah . Should we , I don't know ,
A :  Hmm .
B :  meet up and see what we could do ? I mean , I don't know , see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe ? Or what do we need . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , exactly , exactly . So you're still working ? I see .
D :  Next week sometime , yeah . I actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic . But well , whatever it was , last week then . The the the week as it as is rather than the proper week , do you know what I mean . Do you know that , it's been all a bit manic , the last m the last yeah .
B :  Yep . Yeah .
A :  Yes , exactly , same . Yeah , I mean betwe um I sup yeah . Yeah .
C :  What do you mean ? This week's only two days old .
B :  Well
C :  Oh .
A :  Right .
A :  Well well you're in S_P_N_L_P_ and S_P_ two , right ? So yeah . Yeah , that's where I'm at .
D :  Yeah , that's right , yeah . And then we had to do an I_R_P_ , whatever it was last week as well . Which is only a page long , but it's quite difficult to write a page .
B :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , oh yeah .
C :  Yeah . Oh that's complete rubbish anyway . Never mind . Just so stupid .
D :  More diffi it was , it wasn't marked , but it was I had to sit there and think about it for a bit , which is a bit irritating . Yeah , but S_P_N_L_P_ . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's fun .
B :  Oh .
A :  Oh yeah .
A :  Okay . So . Yeah , I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um , yeah , hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI . Okay . Think that should be possible .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah , we're gonna meet up .
D :  Yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well ye the browser as I use it now or as uh , you know , it was there when I took it um uses the um the N_X_T_ search to get the data out of the out the files , which I think is odd , but I'm not quite sure how it works yet . I don't quite understand it .
B :  'Cause it's now
A :  Okay . Why ?
D :  So when it when it
C :  To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data , you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something . Yeah .
D :  That's pretty bizarre , isn't it ? Well I guess that's how it works . They've got d
C :  Yeah .
D :  That is pretty bizarre .
C :  So they don't , you know , they don't say look in that and that folder , but they say search everything .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  That is pretty bizarre .
A :  Hmm . Well they did say it wasn't the most efficient . Very clearly , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Oh it does load up quite quickly . So you know , it's not too bad . But you know , you could have a look at them .
B :  Okay . But it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query ? Or is it just what's behind it ? So or how does it work then ? D Okay .
C :  No , this is not the actual search . This is just when you open what you know , to load the transcript for example , to find the transcript for a certain meeting , it does does an N_X_T_ search for the string , I don't know , transcript or text or whatever .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Four , and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list , whatever , find everything that's got that and then load
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so I don't know if you've looked at the search query s language , but it's like a dollar A_ text say .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah , 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable , doesn't it , and then they keep Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . And then yeah . Because every every of all of these um
C :  these files have got um tha an I_D_ . And all the transcript files have got the string , I don't know what it is , words or text or something in it , so it just searches for those files .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right .
C :  Vaguely .
B :  When you like you is there a open thingy or Like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses N_X_T_ search like is it
C :  So
C :  Open .
C :  Um um well , it's in the code . Just that it , you know , it yeah , you define a search object , and then you search on that string . I had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary . That's how I
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  I had to I had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself .
D :  Oh see , obvious
D :  So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it , is that what you did ?
C :  Yeah , just search for a specific string .
D :  Right .
C :  So you could just , you know , you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere . Yeah .
D :  Okeydoke .
D :  Fish the data , I was just thinking that , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna , you know , whatever you wanna do , then just send me an email .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
C :  I can explain it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Have you annotated your code nicely ? Not yet .
A :  Okay .
C :  Oh yeah . Actually , in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that I used from this from you know , that they gave us , had a lot of extra stuff in , and I haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions I haven't you know , that I don't need . Yeah , just in case . Exactly . Yes . So they're all in there ye still . A lot of rubbish , but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end , I think .
D :  Just in case . mission critical . Yeah .
A :  Hmm , right , right .
D :  Commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it , does it work , yeah . Okay , get rid of that , next . Good fun , aye .
C :  Yes . Exactly , yes . Yeah . Precisely .
A :  Yeah . M yeah . Yeah .
C : 
B :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh no .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So basically we go and go and do some work really , I think that's the um the um the answer to that , isn't it . The long and the short of it .
A :  Yeah , seriously , on the weekend .
C :  The weekend ? The weekend's still four days off .
A :  Yeah . Well f
A :  Uh Um Yeah . Yeah . How many hours is this ? Hmm .
D :  Yeah . Proba I'm still at the bottom of the mountain .
C :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I don't actually have that much to do at the moment .
D :  Well , should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well Oh dear . Well
A :  Yeah , seriously .
A :  Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . That's what I gotta work on .
C :  I can't remember what I'm supposed to do , by the way . Am I supposed to do the summarisation thingibob ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm . I don't know .
C :  No .
A :  Who was doing that ?
A :  Oh really ?
C :  You do . Well , I'll do that then .
B :  Oh . Oh .
D :  You saw it , yeah .
A :  Damn .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  These can be changed as well . Okay , yeah . Um I don't know , it doesn't matter . If if you want to . I mean it's just , you know , play around with some extra stuff . You have some time , why not .
C :  Shall I do that then ? I mean
C :  Or you know
C :  It shouldn't be to difficult . I mean
B :  Yeah .
D :  So what courses should I pick to be not doing any work at the moment ?
B :  Yeah . That's nice .
C :  Well I'm doing communications , which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago . And that's in in two weeks .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Was that in informatics course ? Or Oh . Oh , it like digital , okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah , it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , so it's uh , yeah .
C :  And then then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems , which we had one exercise as well , and that's in like Friday .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Well I'm not doing any background reading , so you know . Being lazy .
A :  Alright . Yeah .
B :  Sorry . I'm just being yeah . Hmm .
A :  Fine . Hmm .
D :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Yeah . I'll be happy when this week is over .
B :  Have we these courses that we're okay . Yeah .
C :  Oh .
D : 
A :  Yeah . Well I don't know , is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss ?
B :  No .
B :  I don
A :  Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week .
A :  Well , I dunno . We'll probably get some work done over the weekend , so I dunno if after D_N_L_G_ or something , maybe just have a little quick little update and just
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , if you like . We can always decide then , I mean yeah . Yeah . Um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then ?
B :  Yeah , I don't know. .
A :  Yeah . Well we can decide . Yeah , exactly . True . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Search . And well sure , why not . Couldn't be that hard . Well , it'll be , you know , still limited version of , you know , the next query search . But , no no . Won't be the whole thing then . Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do . Hmm . yeah . Well , actually most are just dialogue acts . And what else was there .
C :  You're gonna do the search . You're gonna implement the search . Everything ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  .
A :  summary topic
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's just that I think we need to set ourselves some milestones , because otherwise
B :  I don't know .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You know
A :  Yeah , it'll get behind schedule , yeah , pretty quick . Like you're saying , yeah . Well actually , do we wanna set a date for interim prototype ?
C :  Weeks will go by and
A :  Specifically a date ?
B :  Mine was
C :  Well you decide , I'm not doing much for that prototype . So
D :  Um .
B :  The progress report is due on twenty third February . February .
C :  Of
C :  Oh .
D :  So so what's that , two weeks basically .
B :  Um yeah .
C :  Well , how about we get it done by then ? I mean
D :  Ish yeah .
C :  Then we can write about it in the in the interim report , and s you know , and then we've got something to show .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Just looking at my own deadlines . See . Yeah , that would be fine . .
C :  Um oh and the the search interface .
C :  Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for . And then if you want , you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice , you know , a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Wasn't like what you had now , wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on ? Or was it just like that one .
C :  No .
C :  Oh that's that's that doesn't exist . Tha that's completely cut and pasted . That does not exist . Nicely done though , isn't it ? It's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know , all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from Google online . A screen-shot of Google .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  This is illusion or whatever .
A :  Is it semblance of reality . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's it's quite impressive actually . Yeah .
A :  I see .
B :  Oh mm .
D :  That's quite slow really . Yeah .
C :  It's just so much fun . It's gonna be a little difficult more difficult . Yeah , I mean I was going to , but you know , the whole drop-down menus and stuff , what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on . We never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for .
B :  Nice thought . I'm impressed . Maybe you should make it exist then .
D :  No , it's not , is it ? Yeah .
A :  Right , true . Mm decide on that on over the weekend .
C :  So
C :  Yeah , do you wanna , you know , just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do , and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do .
A :  Yeah , totally .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It would be nice to , I don't know , meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already , so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff .
A :  Oh , just like the basic . So like no . Sorry ?
C :  Know
C :  Know already what ?
B :  Just like accessing the corpus and stuff .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah . Just like all the and seeing the code , and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done . Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics . Yeah . Or like like , you know , the class paths all that sort of thing . Like just just say okay , well here's you know , everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah , just jump right in .
D :  Can take us for a tutorial sometime .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , I can do that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Show you what bits the code
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . That's cool . Yeah . In the morning .
D :  Next week sometime .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah , yeah . Well this time I'm dictating the time , 'cause I if I'm not there you can't do anything .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I know . Well thing is , you know , if yeah , something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah , like my schedule's like a class , break , class , break , class , you know , that sort of thing . So so yeah , I know , exactly , exactly , that's what I'm thinking . So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever . Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah , ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it , you know .
B :  Yeah , yeah yeah .
C :  I mean
B :  Yeah .
C :  Pick a time . I I you know , let me know , whenever .
B :  Um yeah .
A :  Actually Monday , Monday might be good d um .
B :  Yeah .
C :  What Monday . What did you say ?
A :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Next yeah , this Monday . Just
A :  Anytime um , not at n not at noon or two or four . No , in between those is you know , like one or three or
D :  Mm Monday afternoon .
D :  Uh
C :  Three o'clock . Actually th yeah .
A :  Sure .
D :  Three is alright . It was what time's D_N_L_G_ ? Four , isn't it ?
A :  Possibly .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's full , yeah .
C :  Unless you wanna do it after the um after D_
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's an option too . Yeah , after .
C :  D_ and A_ .
A :  Sure . That's fine .
D :  Three's good though . I'll but we have s whatever . What's you what would you prefer ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or three thirty . No , just yeah . That'd be necessarily necessarily short .
B :  Well , it doesn't matter for me . I mean three three or after what ?
C :  That's gonna be tight .
D :  We could three thirty in the in the computer room in here , and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door ? Oh , you haven't got a key , do you ? Can none of you get in there ?
A :  Actually we can't get in there though .
B :  Maybe we ca
A :  W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it what front door ?
D :  The k the f there's computer rooms in here , the M_S_C_ computer lab and uh is in here . Well if you find me , I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there , and we can all go in there . Yeah , yeah . You do need to have a key for it . Like that's the thing . It's got a lock door button .
B :  In four Buccleuch .
C :  I've not found that yet .
A :  How about if we take uh a tour ? Yeah , right . Yeah , yeah , exactly .
B :  We can go look we can look at now , afterwards . Yeah .
A :  Okay . Just sort bang on it . Actually I was asking Steve about that , whether we can get in there . Whether he was gonna get us access into the
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , somebody will answer it .
B :  Into what ? Okay uh .
A :  the computer room .
D :  Yeah , it's only got it's crap , it's only got about four or five computers in But it would do quite good for our job , 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often .
A :  Yeah , print
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right . Is there a printer in there too ?
D :  Yeah , there's fridge there . And there's a photo-copier with the code on it , yeah yeah . It's cool , yeah .
C :  Really ?
A :  A nice okay . That would come in handy , yeah .
C :  Really ?
C :  Ah . Well , I'm just
B :  Oh , is that the photo-copier I heard I heard about ? Yeah .
A :  Hey , we could we could photo-copy our um assignment if we wanted to . Yeah . Well the comments I'm thinking .
C :  I've got it in my computer . Whatever is in my computer .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So what time do we say ?
A :  Um
C :  I just think it's better to do it afterwards . Then we have all the time we need . Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out .
A :  Yeah , that's true . So after D_N_L_G_ . Yeah .
D :  Oh right .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . Hmm .
A :  As long as D_N_L_G_ doesn't go late .
C :  Oh .
D :  Hopefully it's not that man , so it won't matter .
C :  Actually it's not even confirmed yet . What was She doesn't even know what she's talking about yet , I think . Maybe it doesn't happen at all .
B :  What ?
A :  Oh .
B :  It's true .
A :  So
B :  Yeah , I don't know . It's reading week next . It should be it shouldn't be any well , it's supposed to be next week . It's week six next week .
A :  Sounds like me .
C :  Is it really ?
A :  Are you ? Next week ? Or the week ? How ?
C :  Really ?
A :  Oh .
C :  I don't think we have a reading week though . The the
B :  I don't know . We have one class at least when we like speech perception , we don't have any lectures . But I think we're having like all other classes . So uh there's not point in having
A :  Yeah . That's cancelled ?
A :  Oh really ?
C :  Yeah , I don't think there is an official I don't think there was an official one last semester . I think it was just a bank holiday , wasn't it ?
A :  Hmm .
A :  Um something like that . I think one or couple classes were cancelled .
B :  No , I think it w
D :  Some classes did and some classes didn't . It's all a bit bizarre really . They didn't really know what was going on .
A :  Yeah . Exact Yeah . I th
B :  Yeah , which are a bit crap , yeah . I think the under-graduates had uh all were off totally .
C :  No ,
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not . Well , I don't feel like teaching . Yeah , okay . I think yeah . I think D_I_L_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes . D_I_L_ will probably have classes , yeah .
D :  Nah , make 'em work .
B :  What ?
B :  Yeah , th we will probably have it , yeah yeah . last week . Yeah .
C :  Okay . Let's meet Monday .
A :  Yep .
D :  Done .
B :  Yeah , um I guess that's it . Was there anything else ? Do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should I take care of it ?
C :  Hmm ?
D :  Oh , we trust you .
A :  You can have it . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I don't know if there was something . Oh I think he basically said
B :  um the same things as in the comments , if I could read it .
B :  Can you read that ?
A :  Huh ? Which one , the top one ? Um
A :  Do you really want multiple windows from a single lap ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  From a single application
A :  But most will probably want to go with defaults .
B :  Yeah . Well , uh that was , I guess .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . You'd be s
D :  Yeah , I think the comments are basically the same as what you said . So it's
A :  Yeah , exactly , and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation .
B :  Oh .
B :  No .
A :  Yeah , yeah that's about it . Nothing terribly exciting .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah ? And now we have seven percent of the course already done ? Is quite good . So if y
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Alright . Okay . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Right . I think we need to tick the okay box , right ?
B :  If you're okay with uh having Oh .
C :  Ooh . Exciting .
D :  Oof . Bu buzzes . Yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Signing off , innit ? Log off .
B :  Who ? Yeah . .
A :  Okay .
C :  Should we turn these off then or what ?
B :  We're done now . I uh
B :  Is she still here ? Yes , you are . Yeah .
