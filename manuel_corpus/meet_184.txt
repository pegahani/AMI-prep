A :  Great , thank you . Yep .
B :  Smile for the camera .
C :  Hello .
D :  Cheers .
C :  Right .
B :  Helium one . I think there should be a break for and . But I think maybe that one should be underlined .
C :  Mm mm hmm .
A :  Sorry , mm yep .
D :  It should be this one here .
C :  Yeah , it's hard to know what that is . That's this is a bit of H_T_M_L_ goo .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think there should be a break for and .
B :  Helium .
C :  And they don't know what to do with the H_T_M_L_ goo .
B :  M_B_D_A_ presumably is lambda .
C :  But this this isn't a s yeah . And this isn't a separate thing , so I w I would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and . Right ?
A :  Uh yes , course , of course it is , yeah .
B :  And the in that case . Yep .
D :  Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay ?
B :  Yep .
B :  Right , what's different ? Just this . High excitation emission lines .
C :  Mm mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
B :  I think high excitation should be in because it's just saying
B :  It's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from .
C :  Yes . Yeah , yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Right , you don't get that .
B :  Living up in nebulosity .
B :  ESO , I don't think is an instrument .
C :  ESO isn't an instrument . You're right .
B :  Okay .
C :  We agreed for to keep hubble . Yep .
B :  To not yes , to keep hubble . Um for this that should be green as well .
C :  Yeah , that should be a source type , yeah .
C :  It's
C :  Yeah , do you think that's part of the name , yeah . I don't yeah , I have no way of knowing , yeah .
B :  Well it is the whole name yes , I get
A :  Yeah , I think it all is yeah , I think it is all m one name . Yep .
B :  Absorption line systems shouldn't be there . Absorption line systems .
C :  Yep .
B :  And again .
C :  Yep .
C :  Right .
B :  Needs column densities , which is a derived property .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah , these are s s species ions again , not individual lines .
B :  But then
C :  Yep , that's fine .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C : 
B :  And Lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either .
C :  Nope .
B :  Right .
B :  No . For some reason I seem to have just died on this one . He got bored .
C :  I win . Uh
B :  You're right there .
C :  Okay .
D :  I forgot to keep track of the overall score , like who wins and who lose .
A :  It's not a competition . Uh
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , I know . Is there a prize at the end ? Bottle of champagne . Um okay .
B :  I've labelled that wrong .
B :  And here again .
A :  Yeah , and this one .
C :  Mm that's a spectral feature , that's okay .
B :  Um it is . But is emission line A_G_N_ a separate class from A_G_N_ ?
A :  Um
B :  I don't think it is . I think A_G_N_
C :  Emission line A_G_N_ . You can get A_G_N_ without emission lines .
B :  You wouldn't talk about
B :  But I don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source . A separate source class .
C :  I think in Phil's paper he does , doesn't he ? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week .
B :  Maybe you would .
B :  Mm , I didn't it , I just looked at the plu
C :  I didn't know what he meant , but yes . I've seen people talk about them as separate classes , but I don't really know what that means .
B :  And I guess there is a difference between uh an A_G_N_ with emission lines and one without , esp especially if it's X_ ray detected . So yeah , I'm happy with that as long as that's red as well , which it is . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yep .
C :  Oh .
B :  No . Oh , galactic stars .
B :  I think you're r you're right again there .
C :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Yeah , that G_ dwarfs are things , aren't they ? That's alright , yeah .
B :  G_ dwarf . Presumably . Never met one , but don't know what it is .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well it's one of them out um over here I think actually at the moment . So 'cause our sun is a is a T_ dwarf .
B :  Right . Oh , is it ? There you go . .
C :  I saw it yesterday . Uh yeah .
B :  And cluster , you're right .
B :  Absorption
C :  There he is .
C :  By Lyman alpha forest and Lyman limit systems .
B :  But it's the same Lyman alpha forest systems again . So you're right there .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah , I think should still be absorption .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Radio loud quasar again . You're right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Emission models , definitely not . Um why associated ?
B :  I should definitely now we had a debate about this before , and I can't remember why I decided to mark associated . Um what does it mean ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It means it's associated with some physical thing , but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features , I don't think . Does it ?
A :  Uh
B :  What is as associated absorption ?
B :  Doesn't say it's associated with what .
A :  Well it's a process though , isn't it .
A :  Isn't it a process ?
B :  I don't know . I've got no idea what it means .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I'm happy to say M_ two what-not absorption is a spectral feature . But associated means it's associated to some physical thing . So yeah . So that shouldn't be in .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . I wouldn't have that .
B :  Right , okay . So is that what it means in that c context ? Right . Um and associated again .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yep .
C :  Those are mechanisms . So they don't count . Don't think .
B :  Mechanisms .
C :  Um
C :  Yep , I just missed it .
B :  Quasar .
C :  And that's it .
B :  And we should've s put emission line features , shouldn't we ?
C :  Hmm ? Yeah , we should do .
B :  But we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently . So
C :  Yeah , we did that the same . But it's different from what we've been doing .
B :  We've just talked about n und underlining features .
A :  Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual . Uh um it's only altering earlier rules .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and it's not in the manual , is it ?
A :  That aren't allowed .
B :  It doesn't say in the manual about features or not , but we d when we saw ones previously , we marked features .
A :  Yeah , then then do , I think .
C :  Yeah . So let's do that . Extend .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um yes . The only problem , it's done if we've both been not marking it , there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Y yeah , yeah , but yeah .
D :  Well , w within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right , okay . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Have you do you've seen that there are the other one there , the quasar , right ? The uh right , sorry .
B :  Yes , we've got quasars . And this is exactly the same as last one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  systems .
C :  Yep .
B :  I_M_ galaxies .
C :  It's a kind of a regular galaxy ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Is it ? Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Just a p what are you doing there there , sorry ?
B :  Hubble deep fields is being marked . And absorption shouldn't be marked , yep .
A :  Yep . Isn't remote . Yeah , fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think able cluster is different from cluster . Hmm .
A :  Um yeah , that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have A_ bar clusters . So yeah .
B :  An able cluster is just a a discover
C :  Ri right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Soft excess .
C :  That definitely gets to go in .
C :  That's not a component . I think . Yeah , we could come to blows over soft excess .
A :  No , I I'm I'm not arguing . I agree , yeah .
B :  Yep , okay , we can have soft excess . Mm-hmm .
B :  And yes , you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and Compton emission .
C :  Okay .
B :  I think you're right on both of them .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um X_ ray B_L_X_ and radio B_L_X_ I think are because the B_L_ within should be marked , So
C : 
C :  Yeah . I agree . That's fine .
A :  Do you want this one here ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No .
A :  No ? Conti continuum . No , okay .
C :  No , for continuum . Um .
B :  No continuum .
B :  C_O_ luminosity .
A :  I think that's a s species again .
C :  Yeah , that's fine .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh it's still too hot .
C :  Uh I can agree with taking that out .
B :  Um
B :  Intermediate is a region .
C :  That the so-called yeah , I don't think it should be , should it ? 'Cause it's a region , yeah .
B :  It shouldn't be highlighted , you're right .
B :  Because if if we talk about the broad line region , we're not supposed to highlight it . It's the same , it's just it's not very clear before the so-called
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , it's badly written .
B :  .
C :  Infrared galaxies . We said not to mark things based solely on
B :  Um
C :  So it's just defined only by wave-length . So we can't include infrared galaxies .
B :  Yeah , just galaxies .
B :  Star bursts . Yes , they do .
C :  star bursts count , surely .
B :  Oh . Yes , assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy . But they are talking about star burst galaxies .
C :  Mm yes , yeah , they are .
B :  And galaxies .
C :  Galaxies .
B :  Mm continua or continuum flux .
C :  Mm .
B :  It's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference . But what did we decide ?
C :  It doesn't really matter . I'd say continuum flux but I don't Obviously . But I don't care . Yep , okay .
B :  Let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in .
A :  Yeah , I think you have .
B :  And the same as feature .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm no , I'm happy to take that out . Oh .
B :  Broad line .
B :  I was gonna say put it in . Um The lack of broad line polarization . Broad line polarization , is that a spectral feature ? I think you'd want the whole thing in some extent .
C :  Mm no you can't point to it .
B :  Ts you can't get it just from a spectrum .
B :  But you can if you've got a spectrum that's split by polarized light .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well n I think I would actually leave it um with only th on those
C :  Yeah .
B :  As it is .
A :  Br broad l
A :  Line in it . Um because I think that's s what you have been doing earlier on .
B :  Polarization's a property . Yes , okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah ?
B :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
B :  Now I d don't know what was marked here . Have you got the bottom of this page ? Or is it cut off ?
C :  Mm .
A :  No .
D :  Oops , no .
C :  Uh we're missing weak weak line.I don't oh y so they're saying weak line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy .
B :  No . I said that weak line was . Because the modifier should be included , which I think it should . Even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined . This should be green .
C :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Or actu actually sorry , I think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side . Yeah . Characterised by unusually
B :  Oh right , okay . Are we the same on the bottom line ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Right .
B :  Okay , so the question is oh no , it's different . Oh I've got line , that's fine . Line comes out and and should come out as well .
C :  Oh . Yeah no , you've got line in there .
D :  No , is it ?
A :  The difference only weak line , isn't it ?
C :  And should come out .
A :  Oh yeah . There's a line there as well . It's different .
B :  So there's a right but I think weak line should be in .
D :  Hmm .
A :  And an and . Different as well .
C :  Okay , mm-hmm .
B :  Bec i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yep , that's okay .
B :  Right .
C :  Galactic black hole candidates .
A :  They just made that up . That's yeah , exactly . That's not a source type .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And give it an acronym . G_B_H_C_ , ooh .
C :  Yeah , I don't think that's a source type .
B :  Mm okay .
B :  Um line again .
C :  Mm mm-hmm .
B :  But we've got emission line in the ratios . That's fine . Infrared galaxies . That's right again . Oh no , is it ? No , it's wrong . Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  No , it's not right . Right .
B :  I'll get this .
C :  Uh line emitting gas I don't like , yeah .
B :  Line .
C :  Far infrared galaxies we can't have .
B :  And that's it .
C :  That's okay .
B :  Making emission feature , which we're including now .
C :  Yeah , that's okay .
C :  Damped Lyman alpha absorption the same . Right , yep . Emission feature .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , that can't be in .
B :  Star forming galaxies
B :  No , we can't . Star forming galaxies should be in .
C :  Yep .
C :  Uh yes , it should be . Yep , that should be in .
B : 
A :  That's we did earlier anyway . So
B :  Yeah . Proto-galactic lump . W Not gonna get away with that one . It's a lump . It's something . Emission feature again .
A :  No , they just made that up as well . No .
C :  That is not a source type .
C :  What were you thinking ? Yeah . Dibulae absorption .
B :  Damp Lyman
B :  That should be because it's not an absorber , it's an absorption . Oh , covers , yeah .
C :  No , but it says it covers a significantly small angular size . It's a physical thing .
A :  That's a process though .
A :  Yeah , it's a process or a source .
A :  I'm sorry .
B :  Yeah , you cross 'em out . Features .
D :  get this out of the way .
C :  Yep . Uh this feature . Yeah , okay .
B :  A feature again .
B :  Is a feature a spectral feature . damped Lyman alphas again .
C :  Alpha . Yeah , you don't get that . Do you ?
C :  Those are those are regions , globs , nebulae .
B :  Yeah .
B :  after and the rest is the same .
C :  Yep .
B :  Now a line should be in .
C :  Yeah .
B :  X_ ray B_ L_ .
C :  X_ ray B_L_ lax . Yep , that's okay .
C :  Intermediate types . It now if we're d
B :  Intermediate .
B :  We put in type type one point nine . Yes , I think it should be in .
C :  Did we in the end ? Yeah ? Oh right . You get it then .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That doesn't go in and that's okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Oh gosh , this looks complicated . Oh it's just it's Lyman alpha absorption .
C :  Right , that's okay . We don't like systems .
B :  And we don't like that one .
B :  And we don't like that one .
C :  Yeah , that's okay .
A :  Well hang on though . But wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line ?
B :  Yes we are taking out line on its own . So we ha yes .
C :  Are we ?
A :  But you just
C :  Okay , yep .
B :  Every time
A :  Keeping lines there . So
B :  Yes , I think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line ?
C :  What line are we taking out ?
B :  Okay , it's line width , but it's st it's still where it says lines . Have we had any just where it says line ratios ?
C :  Line width , yeah .
C :  Line ratios . We've been taking out line as a
B :  Mm .
C :  word that relates to other words . My head is going yeah . But lines are still lines . Yeah , that's okay .
A :  Adjective . Uh yes . Right . Okay , okay . Okay . Yeah , okay , fine .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yes , I think you're right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Right , I agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing .
B :  No . We want the whole thing in there .
C :  Absorption features in the U_V_ spectra .
B :  Or in the U_V_ . I don't think spectrum should be there . But if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in .
C :  Okay .
C :  It's likely one spectrum in the U_V_ which you can see absorption features in . Uh Right . Quasars quasars .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh-huh . Yeah , I'm right . And here I think I'm right again .
B :  Yep , you're right .
B :  Line centre you can point to . Not like line width , but you can point to line centre . In fact the whole thing should be highlighted , I think .
C :  ?
C :  Line centre .
B :  You can point to the line wings .
C :  Yeah , you'd you'd say line wings . Alright , you get it .
B :  Mm that's just a
C :  Right , you win . Um eclipsing I don't think .
B :  Yep , no that shouldn't be in there .
C :  Yeah , you're right there .
B :  Mm you're right , star burst . Oh , star burst active star burst like activity , that's I don't think that's a class .
B :  It's a action .
C :  Y yeah , but then the A_G_N_ like activity .
A :  Yeah . That has to go as well then , surely .
B :  But A_ g but a an A_ an A_G_N_ is a class .
C :  So both of them have to go . A star burst is a class .
A :  A star burst is a class .
B :  A star burst is a type of galaxy , but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy . It's
A :  As is an A_G_N_ .
C :  An A_G_N_ .
B :  But an A_G_N_ is an object . The star burst , you can't say here is a star burst .
C :  But we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies .
B :  can't star burst if it means galaxy . If this means star burst galaxy like activity , then that's fair enough .
C :  No , but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it . Like an A_G_ an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an A_G_N_ in it .
B :  But star burst refers to
B :  Mm .
D :  Wait , fr from the linguistic side , if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects , then I think it sh it should stay in in this case , even though it's modified by activity , or it's it's m modifying activity actually .
B :  I can see that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Let's keep it in . I I think you're right anyway . Mm-hmm . Yes , I think it was ma maybe if it was star forming like activity , that would be different . But yeah . Yes , that's right , but star burst is different . Okay . Um we've just got this split up . I think there should be w H_
C :  I think they're the same . They either have to both stay or both go , and I I think they should stay .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . Star formation we weren't putting in .
C :  That
B :  You're right , it's two .
C :  Or was it's a wave-length region . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
B :  It's a wave length region , but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line .
C :  I'm right here . That's part of a name , yeah .
B :  Um
B :  You are , yes . That's all part of the name .
B :  Line ratios ?
C :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Infrared galaxies . This time you have it . But galaxies should be in .
B :  But galaxy should be in .
B :  So we need to write that .
C :  Right .
B :  Um hold on .
C :  Uh oh , what have we done ?
B :  Oh no , they are the same . Sorry , I missed that .
B :  Absorption line systems . Hubble . And hubble . And galaxy .
C :  Hubble .
C :  Yeah , ok i in the galaxy distribution .
B :  Galaxy distribution .
B :  Still the distribution of galaxies .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Mm .
B :  Um high ionization lines ? Yes .
C :  Yeah , we did it before .
C :  Yeah , that's okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Open that radius button .
C :  We weren't doing spectral shapes , were we ?
B :  Yes , don't include Platt's spectrum .
B :  Quasars .
C :  Yeah , that counts .
B :  Low ionization . Mm but three should be in .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um low ionization , th they're low BALs , aren't they ?
A :  Um are they uh if you say so . Okay .
C :  Well
B :  Low BAL is a separate class of source .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  Um , I I don't know if high BALs are , but low BALs are .
C :  That counts .
C :  They are and it's a big joke . High balls . Uh yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh right , yeah . Yeah .
C :  Um next .
B :  I shouldn't you're right there .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that doesn't go in . That means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it . Yeah . That doesn't count .
B :  Emission line candidates .
B :  Yes , you're right .
B :  Continuum I think should be in , aren't they ? Although I was talking about conti yeah , continuum luminosity continuum flux , it should be in .
C :  Mm continuum luminosities .
A :  Well you haven't been earlier , have you ?
B :  I thought we had , we'd put in
C :  I don't remember about luminosities . We've been putting in continuum flux .
A :  I don't think you were . Uh
A :  Have you ? Oh okay . Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , we weren't doing broad band detections . We were doing yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  This is nice tea .
C :  Mine too . Oh .
B :  Now what were we doing if
C :  Radio loud quasar should be in , Z_ equals two shouldn't . The rule was to leave it in , was it ?
B :  It
B :  And what were we doing
B :  Um
B :  I don't know , 'cause you in language speak , mark each as a separate entity . That's different .
C :  Yeah , that's for things marked with and .
B :  Mark sub-sections of entities t no , that's different . Doesn't really say .
C :  Yeah , it doesn't say .
B :  So we need a rule for that .
B :  What have we done t
D :  Is is goo again or is it really Z_ equals two ?
B :  Z_ equals two .
C :  Z_ equals two is um means at a certain distance . Um so that shouldn't be in , but radio loud quasars is a thing . So it's whether to include the Z_ equals two in the
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Alright .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  If it was radio-loud quasar , then you would mark it as one thing ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I I think it makes sense to um mark the whole thing then as one . I don't know what you feel . But
C :  Oh .
B :  As one , okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Let's whatever's easiest for you . Y Um yes , take it out . , isn't it ? The spectral components .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No .
B :  X_ ray binaries .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hubble deep field again .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm no , we can't have that .
B :  Emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them .
C :  Yep .
B :  Radio quiet quasar should be go mm
C :  A source type .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think that's right .
B :  Now you've done one and not the other . And you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah . Um right .
B :  I_G_M_ I've done again .
B :  This is nice and easy .
C :  Yes . Um yeah .
B :  Components .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um
C :  We can rid of that , can't we ?
A :  Yeah . I think so .
B :  Mm-hmm . But we want the line still .
B :  The galaxy or galaxy ? Given that it is the galaxy .
C :  Galaxy with the galaxy .
B :  It should be the galaxy , I guess . Insert proper whatever the word is .
C :  It should be the galaxy , yeah .
C :  H_V_C_ complexes . I don't know what H_V_C_ stands for , but since they're complexes we can cross it out . Huh ? Do you know what H_V_C_ stands for ?
B :  .
B :  H_V_C_ , is it this ?
A :  Uh
B :  Known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds . That's where they are . They shouldn't be in there .
A :  No .
C :  Yeah , that doesn't count .
A :  High velocity clouds . There . That's right .
B :  Yes , but they don't explain . I_C_M_ .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Scuba .
C :  Scuba , that's an instrument .
B :  Sometimes anyway when it works .
C : 
C :  You're right there . Should be this and it probably is , that's probably what that means .
B :  Um
B :  No , but no , you're right , and this should be red as well . It should all be . Narrow line A_G_N_ are different .
C :  Oh , I see . Yeah .
B :  I missed out that .
C :  Right .
C :  Beta line . .
B :  H_ beta l width . So
C :  I don't think that matters very much .
B :  Just keep H_ beta , I think . Given that we're not putting line width itself . Even line if it is line width .
C :  Okay .
B :  You can have flux .
C :  Hurray .
C :  Um oh , beta , yep .
B :  H_ beta should be in .
C :  Mm no .
B :  Not that line , but we want enhanced .
C :  Do we ?
A :  Why ?
B :  We we wanted , and this is relative , we wanted modifiers of modifiers of spectral lines , E_G_ weak broad lines .
C :  But enhanced relative to what ?
B :  I weak w relative to what though ? It's all relative , but it's still a modifier of that line .
C :  Okay .
B :  And the same
D :  Um so sorry , and the the A_G_N_ , I think that should be one entity , right ? The the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule , the first one ?
B :  Um
A :  Y yes , that's right .
D :  Mark the la la . Mark the whole string as one entity . One acronym .
B :  No , only when it's embedded . Oh , but the second one . Oh , it's included beside mark it all as one entity , yes .
C :  But when yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , that's right . Uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh , I don't think I was doing that .
B :  Yes , I don't know how many times I've missed the .
C :  Yeah , I've missed that a lot .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
B :  Um weak emission I think should be in there .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Really ?
B :  Mm . If we're including it , emission
A :  If it was
A :  Are you ? N
B :  Um
C :  Oh yeah , extended emission is extended . We we've not been including extended emission . So
A :  No .
B :  No , that's true , so we shouldn't have done either of those . But then weak yeah , okay , nothing at all .
A :  No .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah , I agree . Done .
A :  Nor weak emission then .
A :  No .
C :  Star burst contribution .
B :  That's not a separate source .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Oh yeah . Sorry . Yeah .
B :  Red continuum should be in .
C :  Red continuum . Okay .
B :  Broad line emission and the rest frame U_V_ should all be one .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that should be out .
B :  You're right , yeah . Oh . No , it shouldn't .
C :  We weren't doing components . So
A :  No .
B :  Oh yes , sorry , you're right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , this is this a radio transfer thing . So they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape .
B :  Lines .
C :  Not that that's not something you can point to . I don't think that counts .
B :  Yes , that's true .
B :  Associated again , which means nothing . Continuum source shouldn't be in .
C :  Mm .
C :  Uh-uh .
B :  And associated shouldn't be in .
B :  C_T_I_I_O_ . What does it stand for ?
C :  Mm that should be oh wait , is that s that's an observatory , isn't it ? The C_T_ is the C_T_I_O_ four metre uh the name of that telescope ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  That is a separate thing .
A :  Um m uh y ye well , I don't know .
C :  No .
B :  Y yeah .
C :  And the A_A_T_ is an observatory as well , isn't it ? So
A :  Yeah . But
B :  Yes , but it's also a telescope , and I think he if there's no other way of describing it , that telescope
B :  The C_T_I_O_ four metre telescope is must be what it's called . Otherwise they'd call it a name .
A :  Hmm . That's the actually usually . But anyway . I don't mind .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um
C :  But we if we put
B :  We're including observatory if it refers
B :  If it's part of the proper name of an instrument .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I gue I guess keep it then . Yeah , I think so .
C :  But then we have to include four metre as well .
B :  Yes , up the telescope ? No , just four metre .
C :  No . Yeah .
C :  Right .
B :  Ion shouldn't be in there .
C :  Yep , I agree . Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh no , it should . Iron and absorption . Is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines ? No , it's not .
C :  What is that comma doing there ? Yeah , no oh , I see , I see , I see , yeah . Accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron . What they mean is blended iron lines .
B :  It's no , it's not . I if the comma wasn't there , it would be in .
A :  Blended ion lines , yeah . Yes , you do mean ion lines . Yeah .
B :  So they do mean iron line . So so it should be in .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths , yeah .
C :  Continuum fluxes , yeah , we're doing that , yeah .
B :  Continuum flux we should have all in .
C :  No . Uh yeah . Damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_ .
B :  G oh . There're gonna be hundreds of those . Least it's quick . Um
B :  I don't think that's a separate class of quasar . But then I don't know about quasars .
C :  Uh I don't know what that means either . One damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_s .
B :  I think it should p
C :  It's not a source type , that's definitely true .
A :  No .
B :  Yeah . That's okay . Um the A_W_D_ s . Mm white dwarf ? Um
C :  So
C :  What's D_A_ ?
C :  And there's W_D_s .
B :  .
C :  It's twenty five of D_A_ type and six of D_B_ type .
A :  Yeah , it's if it has
A :  h h
A :  Hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs . Yeah .
B :  Okay , so it is a different class . Okay .
C :  Yep .
B :  Nope .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yes , you're fine with that .
B :  Low BAL .
B :  Mm I'd put multiple in there .
B :  We're not supposed to do components .
A :  No , that's right . That all goes .
C :  Nope .
B :  I say neither of them .
C :  Okay .
B :  Or yeah , that's right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  No absorption lines . That should be highlighted . Oh sorry , I'm I me
C :  No luminos
C :  Yeah , low luminosity Q_S_O_s , no . People talk about them a lot , but
B :  Yeah , I don't thin I don't think there was s but
C :  Well we're doing ultra-luminous galaxies . So we should do
A :  Yeah . I guess you could keep it then .
C :  Yeah . People discuss them as a separate class .
B :  Mm only if it's an astro-physically distinct distinct
C :  They are as as much as ultra-luminous galaxies are .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  No absorption lines should be in , and the same here .
C :  And yep , that should be in .
B :  I didn't . Nice not to do associated for once .
C :  Excellent .
C :  Regions . I shouldn't have done that .
B :  I you're
B :  Y yes , you shouldn't .
C :  Oh , A_ and B_ .
B :  And we w oh gosh , what were we gonna to do about A_ and again ?
C :  No , that's the conjunctural . I'm right here , I think . If yeah .
B :  Yes , you are right , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Strong soft X_ ray flux .
B :  Yeah , you can point to that .
C :  Yeah , that's okay .
C :  Uh
B :  And that's associated absorption lines .
C :  Oh . Right . In the A_A_L_ outflow , it's a r yeah , that doesn't count .
A :  But it's a region though , isn't it .
B :  And absorption and small clouds is out .
C :  It doesn't count .
B :  Ah , now this is the conjunct rule again . And I've done blue wings of this and this and this .
C :  And I didn't Ooh . How do you know what's going on here ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  And this is one double line . And this . And presumably that's red there . It goes over there . I think i if the line's too long , y you've highlighted all i as one . But and I've highlighted it separately . It should be separate .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I don't know what this means . Oh , I highlighted all as one , right .
C :  Okay , yeah .
D :  What what's this N_ thing ? Because that is not marked in the
B :  I think if the line's too long , it's only ha putting the bottom line because Olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line .
A :  Ye ye
D :  No , sorry , I mean the um so so most the
C :  The N_ should be . Yeah , yeah .
A :  the N_ as well . Uh yeah ,
B :  Yes , but I think it probably was and just hasn't printed because Olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen O_ two . Almo two lines above .
D :  Right .
C :  Mm . Hmm ?
B :  Yeah , but I think it's just m missing out the printing if the line goes over the end . 'Cause if you look at you look at what Olivia's done here , Olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line . She would have highlighted the whole thing .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh , I see . So your N_ starts yep , yep , I see what you mean .
D :  Hmm . Yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
D :  But Yeah . But it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually .
C :  So N_ probably should be highli
B :  Yeah , and it's just hasn't printed that . But it is marked I think .
C :  Yep .
D :  Right .
C :  Absorption components don't count .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Continuum source , does that count ? Shouldn't be .
B :  Shouldn't be .
C :  Mm oh so it is . That's right .
B :  But it's al is that also the name of the source ?
C :  Probably , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So it should be this one plus the pink .
C :  Yep .
C :  Uh line broadness .
B :  Line broadness , and I think that should be in .
C :  That's a way of saying line width though , and we don't mark line width .
B :  That's true . Well okay yeah . So we've been in here . Alright .
B :  my table for now .
C :  Oh .
C :  Rich iron spectrum .
B :  Rich iron spectrum .
B :  You're probably right . To the feature of the spectrum . Does that make it a spectral feature ? Um
C :  .
A : 
C :  .
D :  Something that you can point to , right ? Or
A :  Well kind of , it it's uh uh d if you had a s sp spectrum , you have all the l lines of actually lots of different elements , and you have to work out at all the ones sp which are ion lines . Then after that you look and say um ha has a lot of ion in it . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
B :  It's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum , you can say this is a rich iron spectrum .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But b yeah i
C :  Yep , that's the rich iron spectrum . I agree , let's get rid of it .
D :  Oh , I see .
A :  That's right , it's it yeah .
D :  So in that sense it's like like a derived property . Yeah , I see , uh-huh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Yes , it's not a spectral feature . It's feature of the spectrum , which is different .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Right , that's not shouldn't go in .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yes .
B :  And then with the same .
C :  Is that everything ? Yeah . Okay .
B :  Gosh , we're getting through this now . Um giant ellipticals or ellipticals .
C :  Yeah yeah , we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break .
C :  I don't mind .
B :  We were inclu are you not
C :  Are giant ellipticals separate things ? I don't know .
A :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  They are separate , but are they a separate class ? I think they probably are in the ETA B_T_G_s and things .
A :  I think so . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Line emitting gas doesn't get in .
B :  Ionized emission .
C :  If you're doing emission from high yeah .
B :  Yes , I think you want ionized in there .
A :  Really ? Really ? You think ?
C :  Hmm ?
C :  Well she
B :  You can point to ionized emission rather than
A : 
C :  She was allowed emission from high excitation what-not . And that's exactly the same . Yeah , that's exactly the same as
B :  Hmm . Emission from high excitation lines . Yeah . It it's pointing there and saying , look , there's a high excitation emission . And there's not high excitation .
A :  Okay , if you both think so . Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Well I'm not certain if high excitation should go in , but if high excitation should go in , I think ionized means the same thing , doesn't it ? So
A :  Yeah . Okay , okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , you're right . You've got X_ ray source R_ one seventeen .
B :  Line ratio .
B :  What's different there ? Oh there , yes .
B :  Narrow line Seyfert one should all be one . With the red inside it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That
C :  No , that's
C :  This is describing the band you do the observations in ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's describing the line you're looking for .
A :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  Yeah , that counts ? Alright .
B :  We've included it before when you've said this has been detected .
C :  Right , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  From I think should be in there .
C :  S Yeah , okay . Yep .
B :  E emission lines .
B :  Quasars I missed .
C :  Yep .
C :  Ooh . Those shouldn't be there , should they ?
C :  No .
B :  Damped Lyman also is not systems , yeah .
C :  Oh okay , okay , okay .
A :  Well hang on though , but um
A :  Is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there ? It isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh , it's a process .
C :  Ne yes .
B :  Mm no , I think it's a spectral feature . You can point to the damped Lyman a alpha resorption , in in the same way you can point to H_ beta emission , although H_ beta emission is a process . Or emission from H_ beta is is a process .
C :  I think this is what we agreed to cross out before , isn't it ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No , the damped Lyman alpha absorption systems we crossed out . We also crossed out
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think it's a process myself .
C :  I think it's a process too , I think
C :  Especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red-shift absorption . That's not really something you can point to .
B :  What did we do back
B :  Mm you can point to low red shift damped Lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there .
C :  Mm . I'm not too fast , I don't think .
B :  would it be if it was H_ beta absorption ?
B :  And you just took out the low red shifts . Quasars with H_ beta absorption you'd put in .
C :  Mm no I'm not sure .
B :  Because it's a spectral feature . I think damped Lyman alpha absorption
C :  It's whether it's a process or a a feature . But I can't remember what we've done before .
B :  I think it's both .
B :  Because we've every feature is produced by a process .
C :  Well if it was if it was absorption and damped Lyman alpha clouds , you'd not mark absorption .
B :  Yes , it's depends whether it has t whether it means with low red shift damped Lyman alpha cloud absorption .
B :  If it was damped Lyman alpha absorbers , that would be different . But I think absorption
C :  I do think it's a process , I think .
B :  It's a process , but it also produces a spectral feature , where you can say there's the damped Lyman alpha absorption , there's the in the same way that the , yeah , H_ beta emission is a process . Yeah , I think it should be in there .
A :  Yeah . Well that's true . That is true .
C :  Hmm ? Mm ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well we've both marked it . So let's leave it there .
A :  Yeah , okay , okay .
B :  Micro-quasars . They're dubbed micro-quasars .
C :  Micro-quasars .
C :  Yeah . That means it's new-fangled .
B :  Is it gonna be a decent source type in the future ?
B :  I haven't heard referred to since . But
C :  Yeah .
B :  But just talk about the micro-quasar .
C :  Yeah , but they've made up that word .
B :  Yeah , I think you're right , they have ma
B :  Mm on the other hand if we're having hyper-luminous galaxies where , you know , they've just got ultra-luminous and oh , even more hyper-luminous . Well someone must have made that up for the first time .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But w do they what defines a micro-quasar ?
B :  I think
B :  Same as a hyper-luminous galaxy being very very extreme .
C :  But .
A :  I guess keep it probably , yeah .
B :  I reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei star burst galaxy , a dance , is a Yeah , okay . But what about the acronym because that's has that should be in .
A :  No , they've made that one up certainly . I've never heard of that one before .
C :  Uh yeah , you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies . So that do we say we take that out ?
A :  No .
C :  Yep , that's it in it . So that's okay , yep .
B :  star burst nuclei .
B :  You're right . Oh .
B :  The object .
C :  Oh .
B :  If it was star burst galaxies , it would be in there .
B :  Star burst nuclei refers to a region within an object which would not be observed separately . Um
A :  Yeah , that's right . Yeah , I wouldn't , yeah .
C :  Oops .
C :  Yep , that's fine .
B :  Okay .
D :  Sorry , what what happened now ? So you you f you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies , that that's not a proper name ? But you still include the acronym ? Or
B :  Because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it , in the S_ , and if the acronym includes its
D :  Oh okay . Alright , okay . I see , mm-hmm .
B :  Then it has to be in there .
B :  Continuum flux you can have .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  U_V_ and optical emission line ratios . But
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think all of that goes then , doesn't it ?
A :  Surely . No .
C :  We wouldn't have line ratios . So yeah , that goes .
B :  U_V_ and optical emi U_V_ and optical emission should be in there though . No , it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios .
A :  No , I don't think anybody goes .
C :  Yeah . No , it modifies ratios .
A :  Yeah .
C : 
B :  Oh gosh , no emission l okay , so I've highlighted this in r red and then the whole thing in green because type two Seyfart galaxies are one . So I think that's right , as long as this is
C :  Mm .
C :  Right . Yep , that's fine .
C :  Plus red . Yeah .
B :  T_V_ gamma ray emission .
C :  We weren't doing broad-band detections . Right .
B :  We weren't doing broad-band detections , yeah ? Using the . It is , yes . Very stupid , but it is .
A :  Mm no .
C :  That's definitely an instrument name .
C :  Right , you're right there .
B :  F_B_S_ objects shouldn't be in there .
C :  What does it mean ?
B :  I don't know , but it's got object .
C :  Yep , you're right .
B :  And the MAMA scanning machine is an instrument , it's not a telescope , it's an instrument .
A :  It's an instrument , yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay . So you can have that .
C :  Right . At the other one we stopped after four metre . So maybe we should do that there as well .
B :  Oh yes , it should be .
B :  Narrow emission lines from high iron yeah .
C :  Yeah . We did it this way before .
B :  Absorption features .
B :  Weak continuum . That should be separate .
C :  Yeah , you're right .
C :  Continuum radiation .
B :  Continuum radiation .
C :  No . Neither .
B :  Neither .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Narrow line region emission . Uh do you th I think that goes out . Yeah , we don't
B :  Yep .
B :  Oh , there's emission from the narrow line region , yeah .
B :  Narrow line emission should be in .
C :  Yep .
B :  F_V_ low BAL is a source type . Stupid Keckers . You used to b oh no , Keck observatory . Yes , we did decide Keck was going in .
C :  Uh yep , white dwarfs is a source type .
C :  Yeah , you're right . It is . Uh
C :  Keck is yeah .
C :  Uh we didn't allow iron spectrum . So we shouldn't allow H_ or helium two O_ spectrum either .
A :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  At all , yep . And we shouldn't allow emission .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Iso-electronic .
B :  Radio quasars ? Yeah . Oh , no , radio loud and radio quiet are .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Radio quasars are s type .
C :  But radio quasars means radio loud quasars .
B :  . Yeah .
C :  U_V_ accessors are right , isn't it ? It's a spectral feature .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We weren't doing flat spectrum quasars , were we ?
B :  Um
C :  No .
C :  Were we ?
B :  Ye I think they're a separate class , yes . We're not putting them in spectral , but I think we are putting them in because it's so broad band . But yes , they are separate .
C :  Right .
C :  Right . Uh you're right there .
C :  Line strengths .
B :  No , you can't point to it , yeah .
C :  Means equivalent widths , yeah .
C :  Uh I did mis-group
B :  Missed group .
B :  Subaru telescope , you're right .
C :  Yep .
A :  That's it . Hurray .
B :  It's under a proper name 'cause it's got a capital T_ .
C :  Hey . Excellent .
D :  Hey , wow .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well , very good .
C :  Hurray , we're done . Excellent .
B :  Wonderful .
D :  Under two hours . Amazing .
B :  Well once we've got them identified , a lot of them were the same problem going round and round . Um where's the bin in here ? And more to the point , can I get to it without going ah , I can carry my little bits in the with me . Excuse me , camera , I need to find the bin . Um and there isn't one , is there ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No , you can't .
C :  Oh .
C :  Do we each remain wired up ? Are we done ?
A :  I think that's it , isn't it ? We're done ? Right .
D :  I th I think so , yeah .
C :  Excellent .
