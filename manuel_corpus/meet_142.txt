A :  Okay . Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Ah , pinball .
A :  Okay . Okay . Not doing . Uh
D :  Mm . Ah . Hey . Ah . Now I have my screen back too .
B :  Oh .
A :  Very good .
A :  Okay . we have presentations . So first , it's your turn . Yeah . Isn't it amazing .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mine . Oh , great .
C :  Huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Very interesting .
B :  Uh
A :  Industrial Designer . Interface concept .
B :  Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept .
B :  Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh
B :  uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences .
B :  Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .
B :  Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .
B :  Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh
D :  Large . A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top
B :  uh left or right .
B :  Um , well we see the the the same uh
B :  arrows . Like there . And uh
B :  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
B :  And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . So , that's
A :  Can you go back one page ?
A :  For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?
B :  Uh , well
A :  We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . So , uh how
A :  Okay . But uh
A :  You have to put it on the
B :  Like this . Or or this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And that the menu button is okay .
A :  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
B :  Yeah , okay . Uh , so the
D :  Yes .
B :  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , well that's something to uh think about .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .
B :  Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .
A :  Not too much colours .
B :  Uh , no . Not too much . But uh No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and
A :  No , it's not flower power .
A :  S okay .
B :  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh
B :  opinion .
A :  Okay .
B :  That was that .
A :  Thank you .
A :  So , you're next .
C :  I'm next , okay .
C :  Yes . No . Here we go .
C :  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
A : 
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said .
C :  Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then ,
C :  I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket .
C :  Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved .
C :  And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
C :  Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .
C :  And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb .
C :  And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one .
D :  Hmm .
C :  The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it .
C :  And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive .
C :  And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .
C :  You have any more questions about this ?
C :  I think the main thing is we look at the costs . And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
D :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But , thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , not .
C :  Not with an L_C_D_ . No .
A :  No , isn't . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .
A :  Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .
A :  But then it's not easy to use scroll uh
A :  wheel .
C :  Th then you'll see it on the television .
A :  If you don't
A :  Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up .
A :  When you scroll .
C :  Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
A :  Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh
A :  No . The television must do that . So
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which
C :  can provide our uh remote control .
A :  Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room .
A :  And mostly they are smaller . So
C :  Yes .
C :  But that won't be a problem .
C :  I think .
A :  Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
C :  No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?
C :  I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher .
D :  'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .
A :  That's important .
C :  That's true .
D :  And that might uh bring back the costs uh
C :  But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . It's very important .
C :  I can uh look on my uh
C :  Uh
C :  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
A :  Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?
C :  Doesn't say .
A :  Oh .
D :  Huh .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  That's from my manufacturing division .
A :  Okay . Well , thank you . Next .
D :  'Kay .
D :  My turn ?
C :  Yes ?
D :  Mm . So
D :  So
D :  Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell .
D :  So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends .
D :  And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products .
D :  And um , material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it .
D :  Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .
D :  To get a feeling for this .
D :  Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different .
D :  And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .
C :  Changing covers .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Any questions ?
C :  Nope .
B :  No .
A :  No . It's clear .
A :  So now ,
A :  it's uh Ah , let's see .
A :  Now , w we have to decide
A :  Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at
A :  'S next . Components and user interface concept . So
A :  Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
A :  First , uh user interface .
C :  Uh , uh-uh .
C :  How w how we how we make it ? Uh
A :  Yes , a concept on uh Just
C :  Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?
C :  Yeah , but if I paint with
A :  I'll paint . Okay . Well
D :  Mm .
A :  Something like this ? Or
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  Shapes or What do we need ?
D :  Can make several uh concepts .
B :  What ?
A :  Yes , okay .
D :  We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
A :  Okay .
C :  More like something
D :  Yeah I I I uh yes .
C :  M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . Uh I have to . I'm not a designer . It's more three D_ . Like , um when you have
A :  And you have to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like
C :  th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . It's like a gun .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A : 
D :  Yeah .
D :  A g Mm . .
A :  So , it has to be soft ?
C :  And it has to be soft , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? Buttons on top of it . And here .
A :  And uh , the buttons ?
A :  Buttons .
C :  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
A :  No , it won't .
B :  But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
C :  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . And the b
B :  Yeah , okay . But but how
A :  But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . How
C :  Yeah ? Or two buttons .
B :  Okay .
D :  And i if we go to uh
A :  Uh , two scroll uh wheels .
C :  If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back
B :  Mm .
A :  That's th that's more difficult .
D :  But if we have uh a me Yeah . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?
A :  It's better in
C :  with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
C :  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .
D :  Uh-uh .
A :  Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? You don't know . So , there's no menu .
C :  I don't know .
C :  It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext .
A :  No . So you can't use it .
C :  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .
A :  Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .
C :  'Kay .
C :  But you all like this kind of thing . Uh
A :  Good concept . But
C :  With the scroll button . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .
A :  That's one .
D :  Uh-uh .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's one .
A :  Two . Number two .
B :  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Like uh
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Ah that's nice . Here . Trigger .
B : 
A :  No . But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
B :  Just to uh
A :  It's not good to use .
B :  Oh , like a
A :  Yeah , but I'll zap . Fuck . Out .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No , it's not good . Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Then uh
A :  Paint it .
C :  Paint it ? With the scroll thing on , like this ?
A :  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah .
A :  Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .
C :  So ?
C :  Draw it .
A :  Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have
A :  Not so difficult .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But if you put push the the menu button
A :  Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , wh what
B :  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
A :  You have to
A :  For the menu .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . One
A :  that way . And one
A :  that way .
A :  So
A :  Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .
C :  But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and
A :  When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . Like , you have the menu button in between uh
C :  Separate , more separate , h yeah .
A :  Yes , okay .
C :  Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button .
C :  But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like you have a big uh
A :  Very good .
A :  Is it better ?
A :  When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there .
C :  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . They were like round curves , uh different uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the First the buttons .
C :  Okay , okay , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um
D :  The mute button .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers
A :  Mute . And the other .
D :  Okay . But , uh
A :  Yeah . Not so difficult .
C :  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
A :  But how do you wanna solve it ?
C :  With the switch button .
A :  Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
C :  No like uh
A :  Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .
C :  Oh , you mean like that . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um
A :  Yeah .
A :  A joystick .
C :  Yeah , and joystick , I think .
A :  Yeah . But is it uh
A :  Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .
C :  Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi
A :  Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ?
C :  I don't know .
A :  Oh . Why do I pay you for ?
A :  Um , well um
A :  Better ideas .
D :  Okay .
C :  Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And No , no . It won't work .
A :  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
C :  Yeah . Uh-huh .
A :  So
A :  Think we have to keep them .
C :  Or a remote control more like joystick .
A :  Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better .
A :  A small one .
C :  A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k
A :  No just like in a
C :  Playstation thing .
A :  a laptop . Small , round .
A :  Then it's
A :  not so big .
C :  No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing .
A :  Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one .
A :  So , please look at it .
C :  No , that's okay , I got
D :  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?
C :  Uh they're not uh
C :  in details . It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ?
A :  Yeah we I think you get it .
A :  So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
C :  Then I have to come with it .
A :  Yes .
C :  I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .
A :  Your problem . Not mine .
C :  Then I'll uh make something up .
A :  Okay . So , do we have other concepts ?
A :  Then for the components ,
A :  we use a normal battery .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Then it's
A :  Ch cheapest way , I think .
C :  Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .
A :  No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay .
A :  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
C :  Depends on the scroll .
A :  Scroll .
C :  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's
A :  Yeah . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to
C :  Uh the most expensive . Yeah .
A :  Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay .
C :  If we Yeah . If we No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .
A :  Okay . So , uh the shapes of the
A :  depends on the L_C_D_ and But ,
A :  it has to be small .
A :  I think .
C :  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?
A :  If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy .
A :  Y y Yeah but
C :  Just use your thumb .
A :  If you use a phone .
C :  If you Yeah . I use my thumb .
A :  k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is
C :  Yeah .
C :  If you have a joystick on
A :  Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .
C :  No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh straight .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No . No , no .
C :  That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .
D :  Uh
A :  Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y
D :  Uh , yeah , but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ?
A :  N well , if you have to look at it .
D :  If you
C :  'Kay . Here's our designer .
D :  If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it goes like this .
C :  Yeah , why not .
A :  If th n well
C :  It's for the younger people . It's something new .
A :  Yes , of course . That's good good . But the um , it may not break .
B :  It's uh
C :  Now we put uh rubber around it .
A :  Okay . If that's possible .
D :  Um , Yeah .
C :  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .
A :  Okay .
B :  Or you can uh
D :  I can't see the .
B :  turn it inside .
D :  But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .
B :  But that's
C :  Huh .
B :  No , that's true .
D :  Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh
A :  Yeah of course . Okay .
C :  This is something new .
A :  Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , um we have one minute .
C :  Costs are okay .
B :  .
D :  One .
A :  I think . No . More . Seven .
D :  No . You have more . You have still ten .
A :  Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .
C :  Oh , that's us together .
A :  You two stay here . Paint it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Now you have to .
A :  So
A :  I think it's clear . Check your mail . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  It has to be ready in the next meeting . So
D :  What ?
B :  Cookie .
D :  Okay .
A :  Next meeting is called the detailed design . So
A :  Everyth everything has to be ready .
D :  Okay .
A :  Thanks for your attention .
C :  'Kay .
D :  See you at the next meeting .
C :  Bye bye .
