A :  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
B :  Okay .
A :  for the remote control . So . So let's see the what
B :  Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ?
A :  did you prepare .
B :  Mm the shared folder .
A :  Sh share folder for th your presentation ?
B :  Yes .
B :  We have a presentation .
A :  Because I have here
B :  Uh
B :  So I got the participant uh
B :  three .
B :  W uh .
B :  Three .
B :  It's the final design , yeah .
A :  Okay just one .
B :  S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right . And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module .
B :  And detachable big buttons for all people um .
C :  S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .
B :  So .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . And here the the switch that control if you want
A :  Why you why you you put it in the the side ?
C :  Well I I I think uh it's the
A :  It's not a good place maybe .
C :  Yeah but
B :  No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up
C :  Yeah .
B :  the speeches from anywhere .
D :  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
C :  Well so it's a microphone array . No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .
A :  Oh it's very costly , microphone array .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
A :  How much does it cost this one ?
C :  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila .
B :  For the
B :  Yeah .
A :  Fifteen dollars ?
A :  Ah it's above it's above the budget .
D :  The cost would be le reduced .
C :  Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  How many b battery is there ?
C :  How many , excuse me ?
A :  Battery .
C :  Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh
B :  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger .
B :  Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem .
C :  Yeah and you just
A :  So one one battery ?
C :  On uh yeah one battery .
D :  Is that two or one ?
A :  It's kinetic reserve .
B :  Actually uh it's a flexible thing . You just n uh
D :  Now what is the whole day rating for that ?
C :  The excuse me ?
D :  Whole day's rating .
D :  What type of battery ?
C :  Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  At uh yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click
C :  it works .
C :  Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .
A :  Mm .
B :  all in a single button . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .
D :  And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
B :  Mm .
A :  of function is
A :  getting destroyed . If you
B :  Uh okay this is new prototype uh .
C :  Yeah it's
A : 
C :  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . So basically th it's the same uh yeah . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Uh-huh and also the switch . Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .
A :  No four dollars , it's good .
D :  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a
B :  Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our
C :  Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
C :  So
B :  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .
C :  so Norman will explain to you .
A :  And we will we will serve the charger with this ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah of course mm .
B :  Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
A :  With the remote control .
A :  Okay so the price of the charger included in the
B :  Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but
C :  Thank thank you . And so mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Well that's so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .
D :  Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
A :  We have we have just
B :  Yeah .
A :  The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And the price of
C :  Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features .
A :  production
D :  Or uh
B :  Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular .
A :  That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .
B :  Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . So
D :  Something like customised . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
D :  Hmm okay .
B :  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price .
C :  You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
A :  But
B :  Uh yeah yeah you should present that .
D :  And this is other one ?
C :  that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .
B :  Yeah .
C :  H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
B :  Yeah
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity .
B :  So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The titanium and so it's very uh
A :  Titanium .
B :  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_
D :  Yeah that's fine .
B :  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,
B :  uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . Yeah and um
D :  Okay .
B :  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
B :  So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the
A :  What what's
A :  Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ?
C :  Well so the price to produce
C :  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
C :  Uh it's about it
A :  With with with the charge ?
D :  With the charger ?
C :  The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .
C :  So if you uh sum up uh everything
B :  Yeah .
A :  We don't have charger .
C :  wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
D :  I think we can use Excel .
C :  It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .
A :  We don't have all the options .
A :  Charger we don't have charger here either .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No it's
C :  But it's just if you want all functionalities .
A :  it's below the the the budget .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Excuse me ?
A :  It's below the bu
A :  the budget . We
D :  Yeah it's a nice input but we have an
D :  other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think we can just go to my presentation then .
D :  We can wind up .
D :  Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .
D :  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh
D :  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
B :  Mm .
D :  Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
D :  Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
B :  Spongy spongy .
B :  Mm mm .
D :  So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .
B :  Mm mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ?
D :  Um .
B :  We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . Spongy .
C :  A sponge .
D :  Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is
D :  innovative , and third is easy to use .
D :  So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true ,
B :  Mm .
D :  if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So
B :  So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?
D :  We can make our study on this and
D :  No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
A :  You .
D :  According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ .
D :  On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .
D :  And you both agree for that ?
A :  And you ?
B :  I think we can improve on the design . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's it it
C :  Technical aspects .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
C :  Yeah a three .
C :  Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
D :  Four .
B :  Yeah .
C :  removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .
C :  Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six .
B :  Mm .
D :  Five with L_C_D_ and
C :  Well five also uh Norman please .
B :  Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative
A :  Uh
B :  of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
B :  is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh
C :  With lot of functionalities .
B :  A lot of functionalities . So that is uh that is uh for both th
D :  So without L_C_D_ ?
B :  Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them .
D :  No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .
D :  With L_C_D_ . And without L_C_D_ ?
A :  For L_C_D_ .
B :  Both .
C :  Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
B :  For both .
B :  It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .
D :  Okay .
C :  six , let's go for six .
A :  Without L_C_D_ .
B :  Both .
D :  No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So we can't go
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh no innovative yeah .
B :  Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
C :  Talk about
B :  We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ?
D :  I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design
D :  No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Uh then
A :  So let's remove it .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but
C :  Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
A :  But
B :  Yes exactly .
A :  This is the problem .
D :  No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
C :  If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n
D :  L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a
C :  Yeah .
B :  But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
D :  I mean that depends upon your design , so
B :  Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_
D :  I mean
B :  we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
D :  And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?
B : 
C :  Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use .
B :  Yeah I think sorry .
A :  No it's just if I I see the
A :  the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
A :  Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates .
D :  So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's cheaper to produce .
B :  Mm . S
C :  And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so
D :  Yeah that's right .
B :  Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module .
C :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah that's right .
B :  Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah so
C :  Yeah .
D :  So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
C :  Six .
B :  W uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Or you want it to be six ?
C :  Um six .
B :  I think it's the same .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes as you say , with better uh yeah .
A :  Without L_C_D_ .
D :  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
C :  And to improve the the look .
D :  As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
B :  Yeah .
C :  so let's go back to our laboratory and
B :  To improve on the design .
D :  So .
A :  What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?
B :  Huh ?
A :  what about the integration of speech recognition ?
B :  The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
B :  Right ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ah so it's optional with the okay .
D :  It's an optional .
C :  It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than
A :  I think it will be I think i
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh
D :  Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .
A :  Yeah . Or ma yeah . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same
D :  In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work .
B :  Oh .
B :  The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , what do you think uh ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional .
B :  Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag .
A :  Uh
D :  I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . So based on that I think
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?
A :  I think it inc increase .
C :  Well it's about the same because if
C :  Well you can if you had uh something li
A :  I think it i increases .
C :  Oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but
A :  Hmm .
D :  But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .
D :  Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional .
B :  So so
B :  Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m
D :  So it's something like a Microsoft product update . Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it .
A :  And and we we we we we we don't want that .
B :  Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? Yeah , it depends on the v production .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
C :  Well so
C :  Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so
D :  Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and
B :  Mm .
D :  Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well
B :  Yeah .
B :  What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
D :  Yeah , yeah that's right .
C :  Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
