A :  Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um . Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .
C :  'Scuse me .
D :  Bless you .
A :  Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and
A :  Um , yeah .
A :  That was generally how helpful that was . Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're
A :  Right , um
A :  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time .
A :  Does everyone have presentations ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Would anybody like to go first ?
B :  Sure .
A :  Okay .
B :  So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
B :  Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
B :  And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .
B :  Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
B :  So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
A :  And why not wood ? And why not wood ?
B :  And , hmm ?
B :  Uh , well we can use wood . I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
B :  So that's what I've got on design .
A :  'S good .
D :  Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  which is quite shocking .
D :  Ha . Mm .
D :  Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the
D :  easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um .
D :  For fashion , we go for fashion . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?
D :  Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be
D :  um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . Thank you for your attention .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So .
A :  I think it's the next it's the blue one , yeah .
C :  Oh , uh , there we go . Uh .
C :  Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh
D :  Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics .
A :  Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control .
C :  So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh
C :  Okay , alright anyway . Um here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying we're gonna try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
A :  Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .
C :  'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel
A :  You need a screen for it ?
C :  you it seems like you would need a screen .
B :  You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So
C :  But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? Are we
A :  We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , that was one of th I I was sorry , I I meant to update you on that . Um .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Alright . Okay .
D :  But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . That correct ?
C :  Okay . Okay . So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right . Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . So that people seems to be well
B :  Yeah .
D :  Graphical interface ? Uh on the you can have it on the telly though .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You've Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to
C :  You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because
C :  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But but imagine someone with s
B :  My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .
C :  I oh yeah ?
A :  But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to
C :  'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can
D :  Yeah .
B :  They have to r wheel really fast . But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um
C :  So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different
A :  Yeah .
C :  uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .
C :  Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth
A :  Right .
C :  And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , like
A :  I mean with that many options , you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of
C :  I would think so too , like
C :  So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of m yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's more expensive according to the design people . You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .
A :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , that's the only thing though .
C :  Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um
A :  Mm .
C :  You can get to you know , you can
C :  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So the T_V_ is the screen , that yeah
A :  So it would have all these different options of changing
C :  Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .
A :  to
D :  Look it even has settings .
A :  Okay .
D :  On the you can just take theirs and just
C :  Hmm ? Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but I dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So
A :  Um , right .
A :  What if I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or
C :  Yeah .
C :  It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah definitely . Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like
C :  like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . I mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your
D :  Yeah but should be comfortable .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean how do how do I'm not really
C :  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So
A :  Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .
C :  Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So
D :  Yeah I use it like that .
B :  W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  But , were there buttons on there as well ?
B :  Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . So we just used the top part .
A :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so but I mean I think it could be pretty small . Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that
D :  Uh .
C :  you can
A :  What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .
C :  But can't you just get
A :  Do do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something
B :  Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of
D :  Well you can have it on the settings , no ?
A :  Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . That keeps it
A :  Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is if w I if we can do this , that'd probably be
B :  Yeah .
C :  really
C :  Yeah . Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it . So
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's yeah .
C :  Mean
B :  Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?
D :  They already do it .
B :  I don't know . I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .
C :  I mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard .
A :  I mean it would y would that would be
C :  I mean I've never bought a remote . It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is a little
B :  I'm not sure .
B :  Well they usually are . Well
C :  My I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . But um
D :  No .
A :  Huh .
B :  I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ .
C :  So , um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .
B :  Yeah , it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Well so
C :  So , do we need I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . That's what it does anyway .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . Never ever . So
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So , but oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .
D :  Well on the telly .
B :  Or on the T_V_ too .
A :  Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are really hot right now , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ?
C :  Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so
D :  That's quite interesting .
D :  What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ?
A :  Oh god .
C :  Oh .
B :  Oh , I was gonna say . You said uh people want spongy . Um , one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh , okay , that would be cool . Mm .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Ah . Yeah .
D :  Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .
C :  Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I mean definitely the area round it .
A : 
B :  Yeah I think it could work .
C :  Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like
A :  Yeah .
B :  Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .
D :  Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover .
C :  a vegetable .
A :  An orange .
C :  Yeah .
D :  If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or
D :  Yeah .
D :  And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know . Um .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . Um
C :  So I think yeah , colours .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . I do I dunno . Um
A :  I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the
D :  Maybe a ball .
A :  A ball ?
D :  Know , a squashy ball . A relaxing squashy ball .
D :  That you can p well I see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um
C :  That's in the shape of a fruit , like a
A :  Yeah .
D :  sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a
A :  This is just
A :  Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .
D :  Oh , okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for
A :  That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . Um but
D :  Which is cheaper . Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .
B :  Oh . Mm .
C :  Yeah . Oh I like that shape .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a
C :  Yeah .
A :  I was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy
C :  It's like it has to be s yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then
B :  Yeah I guess so .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .
C :  What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ?
A :  Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .
D :  Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . But well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah . Oh .
D :  No .
D :  Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Um .
A :  Well that's not very neat , but
C :  Yeah . I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely
C :  So you could make that
C :  into the fruit and vegetable part .
D :  If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your
D :  to the way you hold it . If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you it it just moulds to your hand .
B :  Yeah you could squish it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?
D :  We we don't know .
C :  Fruits and veg .
B :  I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And the rest is the company the company colour's silver ?
A :  It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like I don't
C :  We could promote the banana one . Like mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I mean that's another question , where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .
A :  Yeah , th and that would that
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I think , um
C :  it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit .
C :  The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . But uh it
B :  Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No but it does it automatically . Does it automatically ? I don't know .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . But if someone components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . Was that you ? Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about
D :  Okay .
B :  That was me .
B :  Yes .
A :  energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And
B :  Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .
D :  Oh , a dynamo is ah , it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .
B :  Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . So I sort of picked battery . We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .
D :  It's quite sweet .
A :  I think batteries sound good . What does everyone else think ?
B :  It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .
C :  The dynamo would be interesting .
D :  No . But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own .
C :  Oh .
A :  What about Kryptonite ?
D :  Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Don't know the cost .
D :  Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?
B :  Didn't have enough data to actually
B :  All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .
D :  Okay .
D :  Right .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem .
B :  Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
A :  What does chip on print mean ?
B :  Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  So , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , yeah . Casing . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Case is what we were discussing yeah .
A :  thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see .
A :  Is there anything else we need to
C :  Hmm .
A :  talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .
A :  Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation .
A :  So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .
D :  Oh , thank you .
A :  Mm .
C :  Cool .
A :  See you soon .
A :  Does it matter that I end early ?
D :  I it's strange because
A :  How how early is it ?
A :  I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
