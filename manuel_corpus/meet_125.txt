C :  .
B :  Hello .
B :  'Kay .
A :  You all saw the newsflash ? Or you got the same message ?
C :  It's
D :  Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . When I uh
A :  Yeah sorry .
C :  I don't know . I didn't see it yet I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Newsflash ? D did I miss something ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but
D :  Yeah pretty much .
C :  Hey what's wrong with my computer ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Is it unlocked ?
D :  Mm .
B :  No .
C :  .
D :  Yeah that's my presentation .
A :  Woah . I uh kind of opened it .
C :  Huh ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm ? Oh right .
C :  What the
A :  Uh
B :  I think you have to uh change your desktop uh
A :  Okay .
B :  size .
D :  Ooh .
A :  'Kay . Everybody ready ?
C :  Not really . Sorry .
D :  Well
B :  computer is uh not functioning ?
A :  No no no . Yes yes yes .
D :  Alright .
C :  Okay . Where do I find this ? I'm not so g display huh ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh display .
B :  And then uh settings ?
C :  Appearance ?
D :  Huh .
B :  Mm I'm not sure I .
D :  You read the newsflash ?
B :  No .
A :  'Kay . Can we get started or is there some pressing issue ?
C :  No what was it about ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah my computer is not functioning properly .
A :  Oh no pressing . Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ?
C :  Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size .
A :  Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah .
D :  What ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Feedback .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  alt delete .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Format .
A :  Format save .
D :  .
D :  So it doesn't draw the attention away .
C :  This is dreadful .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I made uh uh my own map .
C :  No not this , but the task . Yeah . No that's okay . No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened .
A :  Oh yeah sure . You have Playstation also ?
B :  It's a
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah . Uh where was it ? In settings ?
C :  Okay . Alright . Thank you . Do you guys like your tasks ?
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . So frustrating . So
B :  Yeah wa wa you actually
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation .
D :  Yeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch .
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Really annoying .
A :  Okay . So there we are again .
D :  By your humble P_M_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard .
B :  Really .
A :  Yeah really . So who wants to start ?
D :  Yeah that's fine .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We have to start it right away ?
A :  Yeah . Uh this is you ?
D :  Functional ? Yeah functional requirements .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Alright .
D :  I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um
D :  Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire .
D :  The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . Users think they're ugly . Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it .
D :  Um they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay .
D :  Um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the
C :  So they do need to be in the
D :  Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . So um yeah we have to . We c we c
A :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  often .
C :  By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay .
D :  Yeah I mean w we can't my my T_V_ has , but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . So forget this one . Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order .
A :  Next generation does .
C :  No . Alright .
A :  N not used anymore .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? I didn't get anything .
B :  Yeah . I was wondering uh
D :  Yeah , on on the project uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So
D :  No so it's a text file n in the project folder . So teletext can be skipped .
B :  But you you've got more information than uh .
A :  That's in the presentation , so
C :  Alright .
D :  Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess .
A :  Uh below I believe . Yeah below forty .
D :  The new product ? Or below because that's pretty relevant .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I thought I read a
A :  Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Below ? Okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know . Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um
B :  But where did you get uh that information ?
A :  That's in a newsflash .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting .
D :  Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um
D :  And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But it also needs to have corporate identity .
D :  Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well .
A :  Present and the colours .
A :  So we can't change much of that .
C :  Do we have uh yeah .
D :  Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yes .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Okay .
A :  It's open already so you can use to
D :  .
B :  Mm .
A :  find yours .
B :  It's
A :  F_ five .
B :  F_ five .
B :  Okay .
A :  Go Jurgen . You pressed alt F_ four ?
B :  Oh .
B :  What is this ? Oh no .
B :  How do I uh
B :  No no no . I pressed the mouse button .
A :  Oh great .
C :  It's th that's the self-destruct button .
A :  Yeah . Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Okay . Um if you all go stand around uh
D :  Yeah . Just yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
B :  Computer
C :  Alright .
B :  Um
A :  That's nice .
B :  No .
A :  F_ five . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
B :  Okay .
B :  I uh had uh two examples . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . This the easy one I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? So we
A :  The mm yeah .
D :  Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . So not not too much but yeah .
B :  Okay so so we have the option for more functions . Um yeah .
C :  And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright .
D :  And the speech recognition yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . But
D :  Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah .
B :  Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . So w
B :  Okay one device . Okay . I didn't see . Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before .
A :  Yeah . So n it's very easy . Now yeah it's okay .
D :  So there are not extra options in this case , but uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed .
A :  Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . And the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu .
A :  Yeah you make a screen menu or something .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . What does the screen do ?
B :  Did I uh did I break it ?
D :  Uh . What are wh
C :  Alright .
A :  Yeah . It's low power .
D :  What .
A :  So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ?
B :  For for the advanced functions I think .
D :  Yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions .
A :  Yeah that's what we make it up . So but what did the marketing
A :  No .
A :  Yeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh
B :  Like searching for channels and
D :  Yeah searching for channels , programming them .
C :  Ah look .
C :  We have your uh oh never mind .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We're back online .
B :  Okay . That's uh I'm al I'm almost finished so
A :  Okay .
B :  Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form . Now that that was uh was the end . Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm . Content and form .
D :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Yeah . That was the end . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky .
D :  Well you can improvise right ?
A :  Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ?
C :  Yeah a little bit . Uh no .
A :  This one ?
C :  No no .
A :  Functional requirements ?
C :  Yeah I think that would be it then .
A :  No .
D :  So we we can go for
C :  I have no idea .
A :  You didn't put it in ? Or
C :  That w . Let me check .
A :  it's not really English .
C :  I know .
A :  Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .
A :  Here you go .
C :  Alright how do I uh skip pages ?
A :  Just uh press uh yeah . Yeah .
C :  The keys yeah ? Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And well the info on the website which came too late . Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Those were my uh starting points .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . And then make the the design , a the actual design , but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it .
A :  Mm .
D :  Design ? Yeah .
A :  Design yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah frequency . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah decoder .
C :  Yeah well this was
C :  actually all I got around to do . I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh
A :  Blank . Yeah okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Work harder .
B :  Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh
C :  Yeah . Whatever .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it .
A :  Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well .
D :  Mm .
A :  And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control .
A :  And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is .
D :  group of users , or because it says below forty I mean . I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female
A :  Yeah users .
A :  Yeah so I think it's easy but
B :  But uh it's it's also for children or just uh
D :  Uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . So um
A :  Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  So below forty is okay . But we need an lower level which to s uh focus . So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? Yeah ? 'Kay .
D :  How do you mean ?
D :  Uh sixteen to forty . Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess .
B :  Yeah . We we have to
A :  Yeah .
B :  And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Design . Mm .
B :  Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And maybe y
C :  Experienced yeah .
D :  But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ?
B :  I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .
D :  Yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are
D :  Uh you can make a if you make a drawing . Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Aye yeah .
D :  Uh .
A :  Shall I uh
D :  Uh black's okay .
D :  And draw it very big . Oh . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's okay .
A :  no , it doesn't have line control , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah we get the
D :  Yeah well , this is basically uh it's alright the remote ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess .
C :  The remote ?
A :  The remote , yeah ?
A :  Basic .
A :  Is on top .
A :  Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb .
D :  Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand .
B :  Yeah . L left top or right uh top ?
A :  T I s should said right . Because yeah .
D :  Right . Right . I most people are right-handed so maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . If you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno .
C :  Right top .
B :  Yeah , right .
C :  Yeah definitely .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah .
A :  Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly .
D :  Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . Okay for example if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout .
A :  You you need to be able to hold it so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the
D :  Doesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent .
A :  I can't help it .
D :  .
B :  You broke it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Man .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  Okay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the
D :  Right .
A :  You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  And might be easier huh ?
D :  Maybe this . kind of works .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Like if you have
D :  like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , um and here one for for
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh . And the for flipping up and down .
B :  Yeah yeah . And volume control .
D :  Yeah that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh
C :  Yeah I
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And left to right .
A :  And those can also be used for the menu .
C :  Yeah exactly . I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things
D :  And you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . So you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass .
C :  And
C :  Yeah okay .
A :  For the menu . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  You just adjust it with these two buttons . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . And then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . That's more your uh your department to to uh to
B :  And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or
D :  Yeah . But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , yeah . I mean it's uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  On the left uh top yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . But it's essential that there is a screen .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . But um
A :  Yeah .
A :  And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone .
D :  Yeah so it should be I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . I mean i
A :  Yeah . This would be uh
C :  Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ?
A :  No that's not s sure so uh we need a display .
D :  That's not sure but it's
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah may maybe because you're
C :  Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .
B :  Yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah .
D :  Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . I mean if you grab it . But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo
C :  Normal for logical t
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah they're used to it .
B :  Okay the yeah . That's possible .
C :  Yeah .
C :  On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button .
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Okay we put it on top .
B :  Yeah .
D :  like over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe on the top or even on the side .
D :  Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good .
A :  Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so
C :  True .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better .
A :  I think that top is the best option .
C :  But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side I dunno . Should be able to work . Never mind .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . .
A :  Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay .
C :  Can we leave this up to you ?
D :  Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ?
D :  I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Screen is over there .
A :  Volume .
A :  Up .
A :  Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .
B :  Yeah . If we
D :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah . That's uh that's a good one .
C :  Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh
C :  and image options right ? Like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser . If you
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah so sounds ?
D :  Sound ?
D :  Yeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound
D :  But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass .
B :  Yeah it it's just a remote control so
A :  Yeah and they're
C :  Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something .
A :  They're not used often so
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's uh pretty hard to write . Mm . Okay but you have sound ?
C :  Ah as
A :  Yeah just
C :  .
A :  Yeah sounds .
D :  Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah . So you have sound .
A :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Of course . I'm just a secretary .
D :  Yeah . Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ?
A :  Coffee ?
C :  Yes please .
A :  Treble bass .
C :  the mono stereo option ? And there there was something else also . And then pitch .
D :  Yeah . Also .
A :  Uh
A :  Pitch I believe , yeah .
D :  Pitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , wh why would you use that ? If people like talk like uh
A :  Yeah and mono stereo .
C :  Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching .
A :  Mm . And also the tuning part ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Programming part .
A :  Yeah programming . So channel programming ?
D :  Uh so we have sound , yeah ? Channel programming .
C :  And yeah in the functionality of the
B :  Television uh itself uh
C :  no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? I dunno .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm . I think it g it gets annoying . I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s
C :  Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Contrast yeah .
D :  Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness ?
A :  Mm . No .
A :  Uh , so contrast ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  bright ,
D :  Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor .
A :  uh
A :  And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ?
D :  Well yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess .
A :  Okay . It's easy .
D :  Yeah . I will look it up .
C :  But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . The sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . So we need two menus kind of thing .
A :  Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options .
A :  Indeed . Yeah .
A :  Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah with the chip and then I mean
A :  So you
D :  Uh yeah . Well yeah we have power button , whether that's present . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour .
A :  You have an additional processor and and software part .
C :  Alright .
A :  Compared to o
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  L_ s
A :  Yeah .
A :  Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast . Yeah I make it c colour .
D :  Yeah con contrast is
D :  Yeah okay , colour and brightness . Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and automatically um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it .
A :  Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ?
D :  Yeah , autoseek .
A :  Uh name a channel , or
D :  Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .
A :  Oh they get automatic names , okay .
D :  Yeah . So you only have to choose the position on your
A :  .
D :  It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or
C :  Help .
D :  If you already programmed it . If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . Yeah how do you call that ? Mm ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  How do you call that ?
D :  Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed .
A :  Channels ? Yeah .
A :  Ninety nine or something . Yeah .
A :  S swap channels ?
D :  Yeah . Swap channels .
A :  Can I call it that ?
A :  Swap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ?
D :  So you most of the time if you if you swap it
D :  S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
A :  Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer .
D :  Yeah . It's it's pretty uh yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu
B :  Okay .
C :  working design . Doch .
D :  on the T_V_ .
A :  Also . That's you're
C :  He only has to figure out how it has to look . And how
A :  Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  to use
C :  Yeah okay . But
A :  And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You did your homework . But um yeah . Okay .
D :  Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ?
C :  No no . It should be able to do any remote .
A :  No I don't think so . But I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part . We don't have to design a protocol so
B :  No that's
D :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No .
C :  No .
D :  That's true . That's true .
C :  Thank god .
D :  Yeah . So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier , it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . So we have to think of something for that .
B :  Okay
A :  No that's the
A :  Yeah .
A :  So but
A :  Um
A :  The User Interface Designer can design a menu
A :  for all these function I put them on the
D :  Yeah k kind of structure into layers .
B :  On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents
A :  .
A :  Yeah . Yeah I can . I'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um
B :  and
D :  So
A :  So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  Uh um
D :  And and the layout of of the thing itself .
A :  I think th I think the yeah the layout of the screen and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the
B :  The the layout of the remote control ?
D :  .
B :  Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ?
A :  .
A :  No I d I think that's more in
C :  Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design .
A :  .
D :  Maybe more on
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So he's layout and you're function .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Form function okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  I think that's a that's a good separation .
B :  But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Are you going to do that ? Yeah ? I I'm going to make yeah o okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah I guess so .
A :  I think i that's your department yes , because w he already knows what
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah we have to kind of work together . If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But we're not allowed .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think yeah .
D :  With with some l with some layers in it . So some menus .
A :  Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , because that's always the difficulty . Every device has its own
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone .
A :  Menu okay . Yeah .
D :  Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen
A :  Mm .
A :  Back . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . W we
B :  Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but they're incorporated ? Up and down is
B :  Yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display .
D :  Yeah because this this is used for both .
A :  Smart ?
D :  Into your screen . Okay . So you l should leave the menu button out of here . And and just put it under the screen , the screen
C :  You wanna separate uh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Put it on top .
B :  Yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . So we make a yeah a line between them .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But we should place the screen on top , right ?
A :  Well
B :  F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh Okay .
A :  But that's uh J Jurgen's department .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we make it a
D :  Yeah . You just you just find out and .
A :  You just make the layout . You do we do the extra two buttons or not ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh
C :  I think you should . It's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we have a a menu button and a s
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay . That's true .
A :  And to , okay and back , also .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever .
B :  Okay . Okay and back button .
A :  And of course the four arrows .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No .
A :  But those are still y doubly used . Both the L_C_D_
D :  Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ?
B :  Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So
B :  That's the the one with the yeah okay .
A :  Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate .
A :  You can navigate .
B :  Okay .
A :  But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume .
B :  Okay so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are
A :  Those are both both yeah .
B :  multifunctional .
C :  Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up .
D :  Yeah .
D :  L l litten up yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's very good idea .
A :  Oh five minutes .
D :  Alright . Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .
A :  Light uh
C :  Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button .
A :  Yeah sure . Okay . Um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  Anything else ?
D :  Those buttons are are lit up . But just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ?
C :  I think not .
A :  I've
D :  Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Volume .
C :  Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu .
D :  Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button .
A :  Well we have those buttons . We use all four .
C :  The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry
B :  No
A :  Yeah okay go ahead .
D :  Yeah ?
C :  sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button .
D :  And one back .
A :  Yeah that was already decided .
B :  Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button .
A :  Okay that's what we decided earlier on . Right okay . So yeah I wanna close down . I have to , sorry . it's not because I don't like you but yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . And then uh we'll see
B :  Yeah okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You wanna close down huh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's okay .
C :  Already .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ?
A :  I don't know .
D :  We have to ask .
A :  Nobody told me .
C :  Okay .
B :  But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? Because I
A :  No I th believe there's first lunch break .
B :  I've everything in my head now so
A :  Yeah . Or you can just
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  'Kay .
D :  Yes .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and
C :  This is
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes sir .
D :  Time pressure .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Yeah it's a lot of pressure .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh .
A :  That's okay .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Oh no no .
D :  Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . Uh .
C :  Bring it on .
A :  I don't know if it works but it should be saved .
D :  Aye
D :  Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or
A :  Yeah . It's uh
D :  Okay . We'll see . Just put back my laptop .
A :  Should be here . Smart board .
D :  Alright . Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that .
A :  Don't know if you can use it but
B :  Okay .
B :  And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered .
A :  Yeah . I try to organise it by these three .
B :  . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  I don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see .
B :  But you got some extra information uh
A :  Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed .
B :  But where do you did you get the newsflash ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah I got it by yeah .
B :  You're the only one uh okay .
A :  I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so
D :  internet .
C :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Make me proud .
C :  I'll try to . So first we have a lunchbreak now ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  I believe so .
A :  just ask .
C :  Mm-hmm . I dunno where she .
