A :  Okay . Everybody ready ? Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think so .
D :  Yeah , that's a good plan .
A :  and everybody's name and what your function is ? So maybe we start with you ?
B :  Okay . Yeah , my name is Francina . And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface . And my role is to design uh a television remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
D :  And I'm a marketing person . I wanna figure out how to sell them .
A :  Mm-hmm . And your name is ?
D :  My name is Eileen .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design .
A :  Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training well , the tools are , I think , we already I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . Um .
D :  No .
A :  Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So maybe you wanna make some notes of that .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  All right . Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um .
A :  That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards .
A :  Detailed design , same thing basically .
D :  Mm 'kay so
D :  Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Functional , conception
D :  and detailed .
A :  I can't write with this thing .
D :  Maybe we should redesign it .
A :  Yes .
D :  After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that .
A :  Yeah , okay . All right ?
A :  Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board .
A :  You wanna go Eileen and
D :  Okay , I'll see what I can do . See if I r
A :  Whether you without hanging yourself .
D :  See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something .
A :  And remember you have to press so it works . Mm-hmm .
D :  So that it will record okay . Um uh um traditional kitty cat .
A :  Fat , a fat cat .
D :  I've a very fat cat . And it likes to sit like that . Okay .
C : 
A :  Okay .
A :  And you're Francine , right ? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?
B :  Yes , I'm Francina . Yes , sure .
D :  Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay .
A :  In
A :  No , no . No , that's okay .
B :  No , Okay .
A :  I don't know , we'll get to that later .
D :  Okay .
B :  What should I draw ?
C : 
C :  Snake .
B :  I'm going to draw a snake .
B :  How does it look like ?
A :  Okay . Okay .
D :  Uh , okay .
D :  I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes .
A :  Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro .
A :  Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .
D :  Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Profit .
D :  Um is fifty mm .
A :  So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera .
A :  Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?
D :  Oops .
C :  Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah .
A :  I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . And um
B :  Yes .
A :  now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ?
A :  Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?
C :  Uh .
B :  Yeah , I
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .
A :  Small , right . Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Audio player . Oh . Okay .
A :  So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .
B :  Yes , exactly
B :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Divides us Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Exactly .
D :  At um twelve fifty Euros per
A :  Well .
D :  Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .
A :  It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
D :  That's right .
C :  Yeah , of course .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . All the almost all the remotes
A :  Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .
C :  Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah .
B :  Yes , exactly .
B :  Are different shapes . Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah of course yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So some
A :  Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So if lost
C :  Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go
D :  Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .
B :  Or a b
A :  If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know .
B :  Should ha
C :  Yeah .
B :  A fluorescent signal , yeah .
D :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or
C :  May not be beep .
C :  Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light .
D :  And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
A :  Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay so
B :  Yes .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . And uh
D :  So the light sensor would activate the signal .
A :  That's right . You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .
C :  Yeah , of course , that didn't
A :  What with
D :  Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly .
B :  Then , in that case
C :  I i we can't do it .
A :  Oh yeah well , but then those people we can't help everybody .
D :  I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay .
A :  Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here .
C :  Yeah , good point .
A :  Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? The industrial designer That's you .
C :  Me yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical .
A :  Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design .
A :  Then
A :  And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . So you have a working design and then a functional design . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was
C :  Yeah , functional design , and you
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
A :  That's right .
A :  That's right .
A :  And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah .
A :  So um we have well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ?
D :  Mm .
A :  I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . How about you people ? Really ? Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , even I have . Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , so let's see .
D :  Alright , well uh
A :  Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . And see what we can come up with .
B :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Okay , very good .
B :  Okay . Yes .
A :  Okay ?
C :  Yeah .
