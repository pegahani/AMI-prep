A :  That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
A :  So now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So
C :  Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think .
A :  F first .
B :  No .
C :  Not all the small buttons , you don't know
A :  Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?
C :  Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .
A :  Positive .
A :  Okay . What are your experiences ?
B :  Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
A :  Mm .
B :  And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .
B :  And uh yeah . Uh
A :  So and do they always have that ?
B :  Yeah , but
B :  No no no . But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It's easy to you . Okay .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all .
C :  Thank you .
C :  Help also . Thank you .
D :  And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v not easy to use . So we n barely used it .
A :  Okay so they have too much . So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  The weight . Not not too heavy .
A :  Not too heavy .
A :  Yes .
C :  Not much buttons .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic .
C :  Uh buttons not too small .
C :  Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .
A :  Yes .
A :  Like a phone .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So , that's .
C :  Next .
B :  Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh
B :  Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um
B :  Yeah .
B :  And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .
A :  Yes .
D :  And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
A :  Okay . This is It has to be compatible with other things . Okay .
D :  Yes .
C :  I have one more idea . Just popped up .
A :  Yes ?
C :  Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
A :  No battery use .
A :  So more ideas ?
B :  Mm no .
A :  No okay . It's only the first ideas . So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh
A :  Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do .
A :  Well look on your . And
A :  Next instructions you'll get in your email . So
