B :  Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group
C :  Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ?
B :  Um , yeah , go for it mate .
C :  Um , N_E_Z_
B :  N_ E_ Z_ . Ebenezer . And your role is ?
C :  E_R_ .
C :  I'm the Marketing Expert .
B :  You're the Marketing Expert , okay .
B :  Next we have ?
D :  Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ .
B :  T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ?
D :  Industrial Designer .
B :  Industrial Designer .
B :  And , lastly we have ?
A :  Uh , Dave Cochrane .
B :  And you're going to be the User Interface , is it ? Designer . Okay .
A :  User Interface Defin Designer , yes .
B :  Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart .
B :  This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um
B :  First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right .
B :  What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ?
C :  Sure .
C :  Whiteboard . 'Kay .
C :  S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time .
C :  Um .
C :  'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world .
C :  Here we have an elephant .
C :  First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant .
C :  So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer .
B :  Brilliantly done . Thank you . Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?
C :  Thank you .
D :  .
C :  Oh . Oh oh I think you ga
B :  Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt .
D :  Do we take them off ? Oh right , okay .
B :  You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well .
C :  The little
C :  The the
D :  Ah-ha .
C :  Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah , there was this microphone as well that you
D :  Now where do I put the
C :  Just um somewhere
B :  Yep , the , it's just across there , that's it .
B :  Yep .
D :  Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?
C :  I think so .
B :  Yeah . It'll follow you if you
C :  Yeah . There you go .
B :  You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range .
D :  Uh , destroying your elephant here .
D :  Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh
D :  I've always loved tigers . They're just they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but
B :  Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh
B :  have a dash .
A :  Um
A :  Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most .
B :  Cheers .
B :  Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal .
B :  Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .
C :  Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , okay .
B :  Yep . Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls .
B :  Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
A :  Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .
A :  Absolutely prohibitive , yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros .
B :  Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of
A :  For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um
B :  Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um
B :  Any takes on this ?
C :  Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . So perhaps one that was more um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , it's it's taken out the
C :  Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .
C :  Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out
C :  What the user wants uh .
B :  what the user wants , yes . Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of
D :  stick on it , rather than buttons ?
C :  Oh . Okay , .
D :  Like uh control pads , you know of games , but or is that a bit ridiculous ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um
D :  Yeah .
B :  and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .
A :  Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of
A :  slightly unconventional or attractive uh
A :  sha shape for it overall , .
B :  Okay .
B :  So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different .
A :  A curve , mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .
B :  Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily .
B :  I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right .
B :  I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody .
C :  'Kay . So .
B :  Yeah ? Okay .
D :  .
C :  .
B :  Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
