B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . That's okay . That's okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Am I starting now ?
A :  Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um
A :  So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy .
B :  Okay . Um , do I need to plugged in .
A :  It's , it's plugged in . So , um
C :  F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight .
B :  F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .
A :  No problem .
B :  'Kay . is on .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . But there we go . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .
A :  I'm sure it's fine .
B :  Um , from
B :  Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .
B :  Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there .
B :  Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .
B :  So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .
A :  Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  And then
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?
B :  You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but
A :  Alright .
A :  Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material . All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .
A :  Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um also
B :  there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .
B :  There we go . Sorry , should I go back .
A :  I'm sorry , could you Those were um
B :  This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . So I just put all those components in .
A :  Okay .
A :  So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the
B :  Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . Okay ?
A :  Alright . Great .
B :  So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ?
B :  There we go .
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright . Thank you very much .
B :  Thank you .
A :  And , um , the next presenter will be Tara .
B :  There you go Tara .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Can you see ?
D :  Oh ,
C :  Do you think
C :  Is it uh , function eight yeah ?
B :  Function F_ eight . The one at the top .
D :  Function F_ eight .
A :  Yeah . Function F_ eight . Sorry .
C :  Oh right . Okay .
D :  That looks right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  I'm the User um
C :  User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .
D :  I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and
C :  Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .
D :  Ch Oh , I see .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .
C :  A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .
C :  Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included .
C :  So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
D :  So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?
C :  Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices .
D :  Right .
D :  D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?
B :  Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . And limit the design . Do you think ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Alright . Sounds great .
D :  Mm , 'kay .
A :  Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?
D :  Yes I am .
A :  Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the Great .
D :  Oh , I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh . I just lost my microphone .
A :  No problem , we can
D :  Just a moment . Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings .
D :  Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .
A :  I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?
D :  Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
A :  I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?
D :  Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .
B :  Mm .
B :  the single function . Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's a good point .
D :  And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .
D :  Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant .
D :  Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .
C :  It's um
D :  Is that
B :  It's like the news . Or like information .
C :  It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . No , li Yeah .
B :  The and what's on .
A :  Yeah . It's um No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . I haven't used it before but
D :  So like a running banner , underneath
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
C :  And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .
B :  It's like
B :  It's like very basic internet . Sort of , um
D :  Okay .
C :  Very basic internet , yeah . But you have Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction .
D :  Okay . Like tells you the weather , and Okay .
B :  Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? Yeah . Yeah .
D :  P Sorry . Changing the channels ?
D :  Oh , okay .
B :  To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay .
D :  Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
D : 
B :  Repetitive strain injury .
C :  Repeti Uh .
D :  Ah . Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?
B :  I think .
A :  That's rather sad .
C : 
D :  Um , maybe our
B :  Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not
C :  Yeah , yeah . I think it is .
D :  designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . It is .
D :  Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Um okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here .
D :  Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .
D :  Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .
A :  I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . Um and depending on how many members you have in households . So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . Wonder if it would have
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  It looks like
A :  Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It'd be like the ultimate remote .
D :  Um okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .
D :  Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um
C :  Mobile phone . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .
B :  Mm .
B :  What , what would appear on the screen ?
A :  I have no idea still . I'm sorry .
D :  Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .
A :  Oh , on the remote . Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be
B :  Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . That would be good , yeah .
B :  teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Might be quite expensive to do that though .
B :  Mm , Yeah .
B :  Could be .
D :  Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  stick to the basics .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . Twenties .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . Okay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
D :  Okay . That's it for the market research .
A :  Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Yep .
B :  Can I just interrupt ?
B :  Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? Okay . Thanks .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we can do the
A :  Okay , sure .
A :  Yeah I do . I'm looking at looking at it right now .
D :  There you go .
A :  thank you .
D :  Oh , come back screen .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?
A :  Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um
A :  more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Just
A :  we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .
B :  Okay . Work on that .
D :  It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . Real Reaction ?
D :  Yeah , I think .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um
A :  and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . It'll It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Is that how most people feel about that ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .
C :  I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if
A :  Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .
C :  You'd Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Never heard of it .
C :  So is it just Okay . Alright . Right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . Do you know if anywhere else has it ?
C :  I don't know .
B :  I don't know . More research required , I think . But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay . So
C :  I don't know .
A :  Alright .
A :  It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay then .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple .
D :  Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Um .
B :  Minimal
D :  And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important .
A :  Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
B :  Yeah okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The same signalling . I mean
A :  the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . It's not that expensive to do .
B :  Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Okay . I like that idea .
C :  Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for
C :  all T_V_s , so
C :  you'd ha
B :  If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on
C :  Yeah , with the button that you pressed . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . The button Oh .
B :  Oh , yeah .
C :  C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .
A :  Minor detail there .
B :  Maybe Yeah , yeah . Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point .
A :  Yeah , it would have t
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Would it need a battery then ?
A :  Maybe , um
B :  Pr probably . Unless it could be Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah .
A :  Probably , I mean . That's your department you'll have to sort that out .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um
D :  Mm .
A :  um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ?
D :  On the buttons ?
C :  I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S
C :  I would go for
B :  Like a raised
C :  Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised .
D :  The numbers themselves . But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .
C :  Yeah . Could be raised .
C :  Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah
A :  Hmm .
D :  I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's true . And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .
A :  Yeah . But I mean
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That , I think that's good , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No , it's not these days . I mean , it's quite easily accessible .
C :  No , I wouldn't say so .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . It lights up for
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That's good Yeah that a good idea .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That , yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  On self timer .
B :  So self-timed lighting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright we have five minutes left
B :  Um , I
A :  um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?
D :  Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . So
B :  So , self-timed
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . And I think that's un unique as well . I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? Yeah . Yeah instead of like hard buttons . Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .
B :  durable .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh right , the
C :  Yeah .
C :  If
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I was gonna say ,
D :  Exactly . It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . Right .
A :  Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .
C :  I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .
B :  Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . Or , or the , whate
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . Is Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool . Um
D :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So I think that um
A :  that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ?
B :  Is
D :  What um Oh sorry .
D :  Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that
D :  diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um
B :  Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Yeah , or Okay .
C :  Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?
D :  Yeah ,
A :  Like an iPod or something ? Okay .
C :  That would be good . Yeah .
D :  Exactly , like an iPod . Exactly . Or , or like mobile ph . And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . But
A :  Like a cellphone ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . Y Could buy extra
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Accessories .
D :  Mm-hmm . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .
B :  Person
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well , that's great .
C :  That's a good idea . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .
B :  Interchangeable . Um , als
A :  'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . You'd just get one mould ,
C :  No .
B :  Yeah . Interchan
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  throw some plastic in it , you know .
B :  And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah . But if we , there is Yeah . We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .
C :  If w
A :  Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? Because we need to investigate the financial implications .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um , I've
B :  Okay . Let's
A :  Okay .
A :  Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we
B :  I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  Alright , well .
A :  Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . Alright ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
