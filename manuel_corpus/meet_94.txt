A :  Is everyone ready to start ? Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Thank you .
A :  Okay .
B :  Should be just loading .
B :  Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen .
B :  That says go here .
B :  Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .
A :  Um
A :  Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
B :  Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
A :  Um
A :  What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
B :  Um , where you manually charge up the power . Like you wind up something . Sorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think . But it's
A :  Just every , every once in a while ?
A :  Just every once in a while or constantly ?
A :  Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
B :  Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Because you can't really see which way round it is .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um
B :  Yeah . That's true . And that would lead to an advanced yeah . If we have yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton .
A :  display , and the glow in the dark thing
A :  might be difficult .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Sounds brilliant to me .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .
A :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .
B :  I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
C :  Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top
B :  Yeah . Like I can't think of what .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . It's yeah .
B :  Yeah . Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Like the skin ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So maybe the
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . Okay . And the buttons obviously are rubber .
B :  And then yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?
B :  As far as I know . It should be .
A :  Okay , we'll just say yeah . Yes , just why not . Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was
C :  Yeah , tha
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Just for environmental reasons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
B :  Yeah . Like as a backup for something .
C :  Backup . Yeah .
D :  Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . So , if it was running off of one battery as a
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That would be good yeah .
B :  Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .
D :  Right .
C :  Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . So maybe that could be incorporated as
B :  That's true . I just thought of that . Yeah . Yeah . May maybe that could be the backup . Instead of a battery . Like solar backup .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Although it needs some light , doesn't it ?
B :  Yeah . I suppose s but some
C :  Do , do those calculators yeah .
A :  Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then .
D :  So , if we're doing yeah . If we're
B :  But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . It can be stored . It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . Like a few hours a day . .
C :  I don't know how it works .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think that might be a little impractical though .
D :  Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah .
B :  That's true . It could easily
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Like people don't wanna have to worry about that .
B :  Yeah . I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . And it works . Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .
C :  Yeah , I suppose .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Cool .
B :  K okay .
A :  'S that the end of your presentation . Alright . Thank you .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  There we go .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Oh .
C :  It's not on my screen . Why ?
B :  it wasn't on mine either . I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .
C :  You don't know why ? Oh okay .
C :  Is it that one ?
A :  Yeah . That's um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user .
C :  And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
C :  Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .
A :  Oh . Okay . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Or maybe it's
B :  Mm .
C :  the the buttons or pictures or something .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah . So I suppose sometime after you .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .
C :  Do you think it's
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , we'll be doing
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then
C :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?
D :  The infrared is like , that's considered a
B :  I
A :  Hmm ?
C :  No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per
D :  Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include
B :  For inp
C :  Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .
A :  Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But um
C :  I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  What do you mean ?
C :  Like I can't think of an example , but
C :  Sort of like little pictures rather than
A :  Oh yeah , like how the buttons
C :  Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . Yeah , something y
A :  Yeah , as a button though . So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? Okay . Yeah . I like that idea .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .
C :  Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly .
C :  Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple .
A :  Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  A bit more too , yeah .
C :  Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um
C :  We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .
B :  Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .
C :  And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yep .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
A :  Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
C :  Mm .
D :  I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  But um
A :  But what about the lighting up effect ?
D :  You mean different colours for the lighting or
A :  Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh I see what you're saying .
D :  Well y
A :  If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber .
D :  Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
B :  Oh .
D :  But , but I guess , you mean from the back . Okay .
A :  Oh . Where would the light come from ?
B :  I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It should be able to mm-hmm .
C :  In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ? 'Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it .
B :  Li yeah .
D :  Oh . Yeah . They , they insert over .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  So
C :  I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more
C :  Yeah .
A :  um , a lot more tangible . Um , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up . If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . I'm sure that'd be fine .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  If it's do-able we can do . Yeah , sounds good to me .
C :  So that's everything , then ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright , thank you .
D :  Okay is that my turn then ?
A :  That means you're up . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
D :  I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh
D :  Uh .
B :  You're not plugged in yet .
D :  Oh . That's a very good point .
D :  Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go .
D :  Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .
D :  Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying .
D :  The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the
D :  face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .
D :  So , pretty basic there .
D :  And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
D :  Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .
D :  Um
D :  So , my personal preferences here ,
D :  um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only
A :  area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It is strange .
A :  um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .
D :  It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But they still need to um fit into people's decor though .
D :  Or colour schemes .
B :  We
D :  Right .
B :  I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .
D :  Yeah . The
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  The essence of strawberry . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Tone it down . Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .
B :  Yeah and like not , not yeah .
D :  I guess , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Or banana-shaped .
D :  One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And , did you have any questions ?
D :  Pretty straightforward ?
A :  Yeah um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright , given that information ,
A :  we need to start making some more specific decisions .
A :  So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .
D :  There you go .
D :  Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay .
B :  I didn't for the first one . But I have now . Yeah . Uh , hopefully . Project documents I think .
A :  But it's still around right ? Okay .
C :  Where do you have to save it to ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  I'm just trying to make this pop up now .
A :  Alright . Here we go .
A :  Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we oh .
B :  Okay .
A :  Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Does anyone know how to take it out of
A :  Um , yeah .
C :  Just escape I think .
D :  The PowerPoint ?
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Okay , so that's good .
B :  Kinetic yeah . Are we going to have a backup ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Or do we just
A :  But would a backup really be necessary ?
A :  I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,
B :  I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and
A :  if there is backup .
B :  be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . I think yeah . I think no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Go for it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?
D :  So
A :  Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It could be fully kinetic energy . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Environmentally conscious or something .
D :  So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? Okay .
B :  Is everyone happy with that ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hope so .
A :  Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means .
B :  Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so
A :  Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?
B :  Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?
C :  Yeah . I don yeah .
B :  Uh , so that's the simple .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
B :  Yeah possibly . So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . So it's a medium . So regular chip . Regular sorry .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . That's called medium , or regular ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Regular chip .
D :  Oh , is regular not simple ?
C :  Yeah . It's for the lighting , yeah .
B :  Lighting . Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .
D :  Right right right .
A :  Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?
B :  So th
B :  I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Plastic with rubber
B :  Rubber . Yeah . Plastic rubber coat .
C :  Yeah plastic coat .
A :  coating and interchangeable
B :  Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that . Yeah .
A :  yeah , interchangeable plates . Okay .
A :  User interface concept .
A :  This is your time to shine .
C :  We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um
C :  PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component
B :  Your screen ?
D :  Think it was called command interface .
B :  Was it
A :  Oh , yeah . Yeah .
D :  Command interface , .
C :  The command inter
A :  Command interface .
B :  Ouch .
C :  The command line interface yeah .
A :  Did you say command line ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Line interface .
A :  Alright , and supplements .
A :  What's that all about ?
C :  Um ,
C :  I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
C :  what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .
A :  Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We haven't really decided what to do about that .
A :  Um , what are our choices here ?
C :  Well it's just um
C :  w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
A :  You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?
B :  The power .
B :  Volume .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um
C :  So pretty just just the basic button functions .
A :  Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have
B :  May yeah . Tone , contrast , and things . That's a bit
A :  Um , yeah .
D :  That was on , um
D :  one of my presentations . About how often it was used . Do you remember that ?
B :  Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it was hardly ever used really .
D :  I w
D :  Should I bring it up ?
A :  Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .
B :  Yeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so
C :  Yeah , each television .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , well we know we want numbers .
D :  The ch t
D :  Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every once every two hours .
D :  Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that .
B :  Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .
C :  You don't change that often , yeah .
A :  Yeah , it does .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and different televisions . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,
A :  changes like that .
A :  Volume .
D :  The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Um , relevance of two .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .
A :  Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um
D :  Well that didn't some up on mine .
A :  Should we have audio ?
A :  It only comes up on mine usually .
C :  It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though .
D :  Oh .
C :  Do you know ?
A :  Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same .
C :  But we
D :  Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .
B :  I've
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah uh I brilliant .
C :  That could be a sales pitch .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Simple and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um ,
A :  you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .
A :  Wait a minute . Is that right ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product .
A :  Um ,
A :  Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
A :  And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .
B :  Okay . Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?
A :  Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? Like f five different
B :  Y Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  five . .
C :  What I
C :  What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Like grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something . That's just
D :  Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We can have a look at those ideas , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . Um , and international tastes as well , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Not easy .
B :  Tricky . A lot of things to consider . Hm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Lots of yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . Alright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . 'Kay . Bye . I'll see you later . Oh , what did I just do . Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
