A :  Okay .
A :  Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana .
C :  It is a banana .
A :  It is a banana .
C :  It is the essence of bananas .
C :  I would be confused with this thing .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Hi . So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
C :  How is everyone ?
B :  Hi .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
A :  uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product .
A :  And uh end
A :  with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits
A :  with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy ,
C :  Like a banana .
A :  and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
D :  Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in
A :  Yeah .
A :  You have a presentation ?

D :  Evaluation .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay . So you can go . We can go through .
A :  Okay .
D :  So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . We
A :  Okay .
D :  we talked about before . So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .

A :  Okay . Maybe you can presen okay . Maybe hold it . So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?
C :  I give it a I give it a five .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ? I will give a six .

D :  Uh .
A :  which make it uh
A :  new also . I think I would give a five .
C :  It's four .

C :  Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , seven .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Seven , okay .
C :  Well , we hope .
B :  Easy to find .
D :  Uh easy to find in a room ?
B :  I lost my banana .
A :  I think you can't miss it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here .
D :  We have the lightning , or
D :  The lighting .
A :  Yeah , we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but
C :  So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or
A :  So it's yellow . It's okay . I think it's very easy to I would say seven . It's hard to miss it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Seven ?
B :  Six . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Is it is it robust ?
A :  Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control .
B :  Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know
A :  Yeah . But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . So maybe we can put a six .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Everybody is okay , six .
B :  Six or five . Five .
A :  Six is okay ?
C :  Six , yeah , for me .
D :  Yeah . Okay . S now um so .
B :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Tadada .
A :  We have to sum up everything .
C :  Twenty .
D :  Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . That's that's okay ?
C :  Thirty . Thir
D :  Six .
A :  Six is a good
C :  Okay .
D :  Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think .
C :  Yeah , the top
A :  Yeah , the be .
A :  Okay , so six is a
C :  Mm .
C :  So will become eight soon ?
A :  So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising .
C :  Yeah , well it's a bit biased .
D :  We have a good price and uh .
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Good .
A :  So this prototype is quite nice .
C :  Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , uh quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Just a just a phone , wireless .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare .
A :  I think the
C :  Yeah . Yeah , it's much more complex , but
A :  Yeah .
A :  So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit .
A :  The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting .
A :  So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . Okay so congratulation .
B :  Start to eat banana .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Nice product .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it was a good collaboration uh .
C :  So what does the management say ?
A :  Aspect .
A :  Sorry ?
C :  What does the management say ?
A :  I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well .
C :  Ah .
A :  All it depends on who watch this meeting . We don't know .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so good guys , so see you for next uh successful project .
