A :  Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not ?
D :  .
B :  Oh no .
D :  Oh , .
B :  No n I I already did it . It's not much . It's just one question .
C :  Did you do your questionnaire already ?
D :  No .
A :  Because we have a problem .
C :  Uh
D :  Oh .
A :  If you look closely , you can see .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It wants
A :  Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .
A :  .
A :  .
A :  At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy .
A :  And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour .
A :  Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?
B :  No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah but everything is .
A :  Uh
A :  Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah , b but
D :  Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery .
A :  Batteries ?
B :  I think the battery option .
C :  Just a normal battery then , yeah .
A :  Batteries .
D :  Yeah .
A :  .
D :  It has to be twelve and a half . Or not ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
C :  Oh my goodness .
A :  So
A :  You're going to redesign something . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Um
B :  Oh no .
D :  Uh , yeah .
A :  Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?
C :  Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything .
A :  Mm-hmm . Uh
D :  But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then . So
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .
C :  How about Sorry .
C :  That's what I was thinking .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Let's do it then . Yeah . we
C :  A a
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Uh then we have left
B :  But we don't have any basic options any more .
A :  Uh yeah . We do .
C :  And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well .
D :  F_ eight .
A :  They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . You were saying something .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um Now let's look .
B :  Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The joystick .
A :  Uh
C :  Yeah . Kind of . I was Because
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh
D :  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .
C :  If you if you go to If you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still But you then still need to have
C :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
D :  Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um
C :  Yeah it's r Yeah .
D :  You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .
B :  So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh yeah .
D :  Well not all . Not s not sound I guess .
B :  But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .
C :  No .
A :  Yeah . It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .
B :  Yeah . So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be
D :  Mm .
A :  So
A :  You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back .
D :  Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?
A :  Oh , that's for the speech .
D :  Speech recognition .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Could drop the speech recognition .
D :  Right .
A :  S s Drop speech recognition ?
C :  No but
A :  Yeah that's possible .
B :  We we d
C :  Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .
A :  Buttons . That's not very easy to use .
D :  Buttons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No , it can be disturbed by by noise and
C :  No .
C :  Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .
D :  stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh well no I was wrong . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons .
D :  But if it
D :  But it it it's a it's a both a hypers
B :  We lose our whole concept . Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_ .
D :  No , but Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six .
C :  We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as well s drop that .
A :  Okay so we drop the speech .
A :  And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .
D :  Yeah . Let's drop the speech .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Sixteen Euros .
C :  We need to lose some buttons .
D :  But y y
A :  Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And then and then use um
A :  Then you're
A :  Oh and the power button we have also .
D :  The the Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . And then when you in the menu
A :  Yeah .
A :  So that's one Euro .
D :  S so so you activate the menu .
B :  If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ? And
B :  With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .
D :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . .
A :  That would save zero point two Euros compared to No .
B :  No it's three Euros . No ? Um
A :  Yeah . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two .
B :  No it's it's n Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . And then and the power button . So that's five .
B :  It's the
A :  Volume .
A :  And the power button .
A :  That's the basic .
D :  That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu .
D :  Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back .
D :  Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .
A :  Yep .
D :  But we can't drop three buttons . But I see that's Yeah . So that's not a good idea .
A :  Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive .
C :  Which That's even
A :  That's not an option .
D :  Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then
A :  Menu , power .
D :  Yeah . F of the four things ? Yeah , th power .
A :  Four arrows ?
A :  Power . Uh
D :  Which more ?
C :  Yeah , if you if you go to eight I don't know how to
A :  Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Uh power I believe ? Uh
D :  Yeah . Power . Th Yeah that's five .
A :  We have a Back and a Okay button .
D :  Yeah , okay that's seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display .
A :  And the Menu .
D :  Oh , well okay .
A :  Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display .
A :  The L_C_D_ ? Yeah .
B :  Let's make the Let's make the case plastic .
D :  Yeah well we need the advanced
D :  Instead of r
A :  Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but but that's not our market .
C :  True .
B :  But
A :  No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .
D :  Ah no , hard plastic .
B :  Plastic with a with a special colour . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . That's an option .
C :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , plastic with special colour .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah okay uh
D :  No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . So let's go for the plastic .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . Yeah , yeah .
B :  So we do one one s Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . Plastic .
D :  And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?
A :  Uh that's easy because plastic is free .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  We still have problem of two Euros .
A :  Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh
B :  No the buttons , those are really needed .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah we can't drop them .
B :  Yeah th th it's it's uh
B :  An advanced chip-on-print .
C :  Yeah uh
D :  Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ?
A :  You still need that .
C :  You uh uh
C :  Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter .
A :  S
D :  Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo .
A :  No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So
C :  Well yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Oh that
A :  Yeah and something else .
D :  Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right .
C :  Yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already .
C :  And then if w
D :  And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but
A :  No y you would rec
A :  Then you have
C :  Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? And uh
A :  Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .
B :  But the
A :  Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .
B :  But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Three . Up , down , Okay .
C :  Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .
B :  Okay .
D :  You you press it for like three seconds .
D :  Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen .
A :  Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but we'd Alright .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I guess we have to .
D :  It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half .
D :  So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left .
C :  We'll we'll be on
A :  Yeah . You see ? Oh still Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .
D :  Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option .
A :  Shit . Drop the special colour .
B :  Oh no .
A :  'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ?
B :  No no , it has to be um curved .
D :  We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it says right here .
A :  They made it very easy for us .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well yeah . yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature .
A :  Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than
B :  Okay . Wh what we could do is um
B :  drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Buttons . That's Oh yeah since we only have one button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
A :  I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular .
B :  Just something else than than black or white I think .
D :  S yeah . Alright .
A :  Grey and rubber .
C :  But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Damn .
A :  Of plastic .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option .
C :  Yeah and then
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  The display
C :  Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  The
B :  But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the
D :  Yeah .
C :  I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no .
C :  .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ?
D :  Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of
B :  No no it has to be curved . Yeah .
D :  Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . And a screen .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . That's the most import
A :  Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ?
B :  Yeah or spe special form ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Maybe that's nicer .
A :  Yeah ? It's for scroll
B :  Yeah .
D :  But we don't have any buttons . So do d Uh make it a special colour then .
A :  Without
C :  We only have
B :  Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or
D :  Yeah ma make it a special colour then .
C :  Yeah but
A :  Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So
B :  Yeah . Okay . Yeah .
D :  Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . So
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yep .
A :  So Woah we're within budget . It's a miracle .
D :  Yeah . Let's let's save it .
B :  Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . Um , well
A :  . 'Kay , this was old .
C :  Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ?
B :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much
A :  Yeah back to work . Uh
C :  It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .
A :  Did I save it ?
A :  Yeah . I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So
D :  Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it .
C :  Oh yeah ?
C :  okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute .
A : 
A :  .
D :  Yeah what's the next uh phase ?
A :  Yeah , this the last phase of course , so
D :  Uh the agenda .
D :  By your humble P_M_ .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh f Frustrated . Alright .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um
A :  Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . Uh
C :  Drop everything . Yeah .
D :  Drop , yeah .
C :  We went straight into finance ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah it was more important , so I just
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  For Yeah .
A :  pushed up the agenda . Uh ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ?
D :  Yeah that that's Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so
A :  Uh you put it in the .
D :  We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Alright .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Let's make it big .
A :  F_ five .
D :  Um
D :  Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .
D :  Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No .
A :  Alt up
D :  And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ?
A :  Freaky .
D :  Oh . I don't know . Um
D :  Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions .
D :  How do you think about that ?
C :  I think it does . Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ?
A :  Yeah . Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh
D :  Yeah the us u
D :  It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . So do you think
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So
D :  Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .
B :  Yep .
C :  I
C :  No .
D :  So on a scale from
D :  one to seven , what do you think ?
B :  Two or three .
D :  Huh ?
B :  Two or three .
D :  Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? I agree on two .
A :  Two .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh y we should fill this in now . Yeah okay . Uh
D :  Yeah . I uh I say two , personally . But
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two .
C :  Yeah alright .
D :  Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .
A :  Okay then I say three .
D :  Yeah ? You say three , and you you said al also three ? Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hey , you're marketing , eh .
A :  Hmm . M maybe underline .
B :  Or give it a colour .
A :  Red .
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore .
A :  Oh yeah very true . He types everything .
D :  Alright .
D :  Yeah . Um well the remote control has Wha
B :  Yeah true one .
C :  Definitely one . It has to be .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings .
B :  It hides uh basic functions .
A :  Everything . You don't use anything else .
D :  Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them
C :  You're not gonna find them .
A :  Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah .
B :  Yeah true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case .
D :  Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Power button .
C :  Yeah the next Not so much so .
A :  Nope .
D :  Do we ha still have a power button ? Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ?
A :  Uh check with the Excel sheet .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think we are
C :  Yeah it's uh it's integrated .
D :  Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah . I don't know . Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions .
B :  It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah .
A :  Yeah integrate it .
C :  E exactly just like a m mobile .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Just go scrolling and it will activate .
C :  .
D :  Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no .
D :  So it's I don't know .
A :  It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but
B :  Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? No , you have to scroll through the menu , before
D :  Yeah .
D :  With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then
B :  Yeah . So it's it's not
C :  Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,
D :  Hmm ?
A :  You say you double click on the
C :  It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
C :  No because it has four arrows , right ?
A :  No , not anymore . Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in .
B :  No .
D :  No .
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick .
A :  Like on the the mouse .
D :  No we have n we have no buttons left . So the joystick was not an option . So so you hav So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Alright .
C :  Say .
C :  Yeah that is a bummer .
A :  Yeah .
A :  To get into menu . Yeah .
B :  Oh no .
A :  Or hold it ten seconds .
C :  We'll make it a Morse code .
D :  But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . So that's Yeah but that that's not a question . Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . Well I think it's pretty much in the middle .
A :  No no no . Uh it should be trendy .
A :  Yeah . Four .
D :  You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So
A :  Yeah , im in the menu .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Seven .
D :  So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or
B :  Yeah . Five .
C :  Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Five or six ?
A :  Five .
C :  Okay five . Let's not diss our remote .
B :  Five . Yep .
D :  Five ? Alright . Yeah .
A :  It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So
D :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Just one button .
A :  Well it's different .
D :  Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation .
C :  But Uh yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's still
A :  Yeah , I say two .
C :  We still have the fruit and vegetable print .
D :  I say two then .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , that's the next .
D :  Yeah but that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question .
C :  Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost .
D :  This one .
B :  I think a two . No .
A :  Two .
D :  Two yeah . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What ? Oh not the bold one .
C :  .
B :  Yep .
A :  Yeah definitely .
C :  It's way more practical , yeah .
D :  Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . But the look and feel
C :  Yeah .
A :  You still have rubber d Or no .
C :  Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button .
B :  No you got a plastic .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The button has also colour . Yeah .
C :  Yeah ? Okay .
A :  Yeah . The one button we have .
D :  Yeah . The one .
C :  Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .
A :  Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .
D :  Mm mm .
B :  Yeah . You only have one Yeah .
D :  Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something .
C :  And and colour .
C :  Yeah . S
B :  Four . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean it's
A :  Yeah or three .
C :  Uh
D :  worth the Yeah .
A :  We have something .
C :  Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  New . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red .
B :  Red .
D :  Yeah .
A :  You like both .
D :  Yeah . I like bold .
D :  Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo .
A :  Um oh yeah .
B :  Mm yeah yeah .
C :  Of course .
A :  I just couldn't Um , just one minute .
D :  Yeah . You just have to draw it .
C :  Yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the
B :  It's the white part uh
A :  .
B :  Yeah . We have a we have a
D :  Yeah .
C :  So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But
A :  So
D :  But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing .
C :  Hell yeah . If we have only one button .
D :  Yeah . So I will say that is very true .
A :  .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? So
D :  Yeah . The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so .
C :  No .
C :  The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button .
B :  Ah i
D :  Yeah .
B :  And that you only have to control one button .
C :  Yeah exactly .
D :  Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But Yeah .
B :  It gives visual feedback . So
D :  Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .
C :  I would say six .
B :  I think a five . Five .
D :  What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ?
C :  It's really not easy to use . 'Cause you're putting everything
A :  No not anymore .
D :  So a six , more .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So
B :  Okay . Yeah .
C :  Most votes count . Um
D :  Um well , another question , uh the remote control is durable . I don't know if that's the correct word . But uh
B :  Yeah that looks uh great .
B :  Yeah . Nah
C :  Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .
D :  In use , both battery as casing ?
D :  Yeah ?
D :  True , true . And the casing is plastic , ?
C :  And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever .
B :  Yep .
D :  Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So I would go for one .
D :  Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate
B :  Yeah . S
B :  Yep .
A : 
C :  Okay yeah .
D :  than
B :  Wow .
D :  Yeah . Logo . Okay I will go go for two .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics .
C :  Oh .
C :  No m
B :  No we put the electronics into the fashion .
A :  Yeah well yeah .
C :  I would g I would go for four .
D :  uh turn around . Yeah . But um
A :  No
D :  Yeah ?
C :  Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .
D :  It's not
D :  Yeah , true .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  So a four . It's it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah , four is okay .
D :  Alright , yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  So
D :  So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .
C :  That's it .
A :  Ooh . And Yeah ? What ?
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh Alright . Word document , the Yeah we have to count them .
A :  Yeah . That
A :  Count them . Add them ? Or
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Yeah .
A :  Could somebody start calculator ?
D :  Mm . I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh Yes .
C :  Ah we can do the math . Uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah . You have to 'Kay . So four and
C :  Yeah .
C :  Did you make this questionnaire or what ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Thanks .
A :  Nice work .
B :  Okay .
C :  Oh .
B :  Three plus ?
C :  I wouldn't be able to do it that fast .
A :  O one .
B :  Plus one .
A :  Plus five .
B :  Plus five ?
D :  Oh Easy . Question number four , yeah ?
A :  Bo
A :  Uh two .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Four .
B :  Oh . Wait a second . Oh . It's it's gone wrong .
D :  How hard is it ?
B :  Okay . It's your turn .
C :  Pretty difficult .
D :  Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads .
B :  No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s
A :  Start over ?
A :  You can Oh yeah .
B :  No . That's why it's uh
D :  It's a it's a bit uh
C :  Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together .
D :  Yeah . I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over . Three , plus one , four . Nine .
B :  Just count it to Yeah .
A :  Okay . Three , four , nine .
A :  Uh
D :  Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Fifteen .
C :  Eleven . Fifteen .
A :  Eleven , fifteen .
B :  Sixteen .
C :  Sixteen .
D :  Sixteen , yeah .
C :  Seventeen .
D :  No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Twenty two .
A :  Seventeen .
C :  Oh what ?
B :  Twenty two .
A :  S Uh
C :  How hard is this ? Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight .
D :  Twenty two , yeah ? Tw
B :  Twenty four . Twenty six .
D :  Twenty Twenty eight .
B :  Oh , sorry . . Oh my .
A :  That was the last one . That was that . Yeah . So divided by nine .
C :  Twenty eight .
B :  Okay . Twenty eight .
D :  Twen Uh okay .
D :  By nine . That's uh three uh Or le less than a three .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So
C :  Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better , right ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Twenty eight
C :  Yeah but
A :  Divided by nine .
D :  di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one .
A :  So thr t two .
A :  So we're better than average .
C :  But
D :  Yeah .
C :  I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question
A :  No .
B :  Some questions are Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Good example . Durable use . Easy to use . This is good . Fancy look and feel , that's good . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Re relevant most used function . And hides these functions . That was also a good thing .
C :  No ?
C :  Durable , that's good . Easy to use .
C :  Yeah . . Also good .
C :  Yeah okay .
C :  I guess you did do it .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah yeah . No
D :  And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah true .
D :  Yes , so the It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess .
B :  Oh great .
A :  Things , yeah .
C :  Yeah definitely definitely . Because now it's just an average It's remote .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but
C :  Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .
D :  Yeah . So th
A :  It's still yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Has some shortcomings .
D :  No . The colour and the screen .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay so Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation . Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but
C :  Product evaluation .
D :  Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
B :  Okay it's your turn now .
A :  So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Shall we try ?
D :  With some casing around it , yeah .
C :  Black .
C :  Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ?
A :  Yeah uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or
A :  The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .
D :  Yeah .
C :  One scroll button and
A :  It's plastic . And single curved .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .
B :  Oh oh no .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well .
C :  For what ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that's
D :  Do we have to do other things ?
A :  Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . So I
D :  Or just redesign ?
D :  Alright .
D :  Yeah . So you made a start , right ?
A :  Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me .
C :  Should give it some time ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yay .
B :  Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? It's just one yeah .
A :  Uh
A :  I was here . So
C :  Have to take this away also .
D :  Alright .
A :  Ah
C :  And this um
B :  Uh that's the infrared uh thing .
C :  Oh yeah , of course . Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths , now that's a ten .
D :  The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  That's conceptual , yes .
A :  That's enough to get started with , so
B :  Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ?
D :  Mm .
C :  It's gonna be one str scroll .
D :  How many pages ?
A :  Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion .
D :  Alright . Y you have you have done the first two .
B :  I think
C :  Horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , and and the look and feel is
B :  Yeah .
C :  Is it more natural than this ?
A :  Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  So let's say Whoops . 'Kay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes . It doesn't look like uh
C :  Basically .
D :  The items we had to drop .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh it it's it's not Yeah .
B :  It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay .
C :  It's really ugly .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Where did we start with price ? Twenty six and a half .
B :  Maybe m make it bigger ? Or
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Or not ?
A :  ... .
D :  Or twenty six ? Something like that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That looks little bit more uh
C :  Oh
B :  Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ?
D :  This ?
C :  What do you mean ?
C :  Like a other colour than this one ?
B :  Or or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh
D :  Speckles ?
C :  Yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print ?
B :  I'm not sure .
C :  I think we have to choose , yeah ?
A :  I don't think so , if you see the options . But
D :  Uh
C :  Okay special colour . We do have special colour .
C :  Does it mean uh that
B :  Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So
B :  It's not very special , but uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Purdy .
D :  Yeah . Some some big dots .
B :  Just uh put the purple uh purple on it . That's trendy .
C :  Purple ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
D :  ... .
C :  Oh no my remote has acne .
D :  We have the original balance sheet , or Yeah .
A :  Yeah .

C :  Is that that ?
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  No no . Yeah .
C :  How the We did we do that ?
B :  Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or
D :  Just dual screen .
B :  No .
B :  But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or
C :  We can try .
C :  That doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's
B :  Crashed . Oh , no .
C :  No ,
D :  Very nice .
B :  Okay .
C :  Where do you want some more dots ?
B :  Yeah , over here . Hmm ?
A :  You can't even draw anymore . Even children can draw .
D :  Yeah . Y y you you you push the button or something . Or
B :  What's this ?

B :  Oh yeah .
B :  Oh that's the select button . It's uh
A :  Hmm .
C :  Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know .

C :  Yeah . It's a
B :  Two R_s and a one
A :  Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials .
D :  You can copy and paste the picture if you want .
B :  .
C :  How Shall we do the logo in black or not ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  What is that ? Look more Looks more like a campfire .
C :  Are you dissing my drawing ? This one ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  It looks like a ribbon .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  So who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ?
C :  I hear you people are typing .
B :  Are we uh ready ? Uh Or

C :  Oh , okay .
D :  I don't see any new messages . So
A :  Luckily . Yeah , it's uh Yeah .
D :  Hmm ? Luckily , yeah .
B :  Is this uh the last assignment ? Or
B :  Final
C :  It's almost four .
D :  What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or
C :  At four , yeah , ?
D :  Or before that ?
A :  Okay . And copy this . Just a minute .
D :  Just compare uh
C :  This is really bizarre .
A :  It's
C :  It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly .
B :  Um bug . Bug .
A :  It's somewhere
B :  No it's in inside the
A :  I d It isn't inside . Yeah , and don't know how it's or eject it .
D :  No it's on the on the beamer I guess .
B :  No it Oh .
C :  No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing .
A :  From up there ?
A :  No .
B :  Hey , you've got it uh read only . So you have to uh
A :  Yeah it's somewhere in here .
A :  Save copy .
D :  Yeah . Strange .
D :  This something what's projection from behind , I guess .
A :  Yeah .
B :  .
B :  It's too uh
A :  .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah there is some kind of projection I think .
D :  Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a within a mirror , yeah . So it looks like a big screen , but in fact it isn't .
A :  Yes .
C :  With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . Yeah .
A :  .
C :  So are we gonna change anything to this ? I mean is it gonna
B :  It is
D :  Well it's it's single single curved .
A :  Well
B :  It's now single curved . So
D :  Th this is flat . Yeah .
C :  This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly .
B :  It's flat . Oh no .
B :  Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's
D :  But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .
D :  I mean you see more of this than of that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , more like that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And this is also gonna be
D :  It's not very uh ideal .
C :  Nope .
D :  Do like this .
C :  But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work .
D :  Yeah .
D :  What's this ?
B :  That's the detector uh for the
D :  Ooh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Maybe
D :  But I don't see a detector over there .
B :  Yeah . I don't know .
C :  No it's I think you only need two points . Or not .
C :  No , you sh
D :  I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .
B :  Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more
C :  Slanted yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or just messed it up .
C :  Well maybe .
B :  Oh . Oh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but it wasn't good .
B :  You've to make it s uh
B :  ninety degrees .
D :  Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here .
A :  Um now you probably have to recalibrate . Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . And the recalibration is done using this icon here .
B :  You have
D :  Oh .
B :  Oh we're always long .
B :  Yeah , can we t can we get to that i
D :  Ooh .
B :  Oh it's not working anymore .
A :  Yeah well I just
D :  Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again .
B :  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . You go ahead .
D :  It's better than before .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We're improving uh Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's improved uh pretty much .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but it's better , it's better
B :  No it
D :  Mm .
D :  No . It's better than it was I guess .
C :  Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy .
D :  Silly .
D :  Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over . And then ? We have to present
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Then I have to uh uh write this , and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far .
D :  Alright .
C :  Maybe we will .
A :  Maybe we get a a final mail .
D :  So it after the after after these five minutes , you have to
A :  Yeah . Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .
C :  What's this anyway ?
B :  So cake .
D :  Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or Alright . And we uh
C :  It looks like candle wax .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please .
D :  Right . Chill .
D :  Huh .
A :  Uh over there .
D :  Uh Yeah ?
A :  The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh
A :  Yeah next .
D :  Next slide .
A :  Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Uh
D :  Yeah ? How do you do it ?
A :  Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um
D :  Alright .
A :  So how were did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh
C :  Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or
A :  Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .
C :  Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . And the third time yeah , I mean
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So
B :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah we
D :  The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Especially after the first meeting .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And
D :  Yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Definitely .
A :  Okay and was that due to my leadership ?
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That okay ?
A :  Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?
C :  I guess so .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah .
C :  I mean
D :  Li Limiteded afterwards , but
D :  If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh
C :  We were pretty democratic .
D :  the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .
A :  So and the uh about the board digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ooh .
D :  Mm uh I think in in essence
D :  the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh
A :  Yeah it works .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe Yeah .
