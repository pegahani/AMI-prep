A :  Mm .
D :  So , Hi Christa .
A :  So , uh now it's the Hi Sammy . It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . And that's all . Okay . So first , let's uh
B :  And chocolate ?
D :  Mm .
A :  see the prototype .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , here we have our prototype model .
A :  Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .
B :  Yes , and place some slides .
A :  Okay . Uh so in which uh
C :  In
B :  Uh , participant three .
B :  Prototype .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm okay . Mm .
C :  Five .
B :  Uh , so
C :  Him .
B :  this is our
B :  remote control .
B :  It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um ,
A :  MASA ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  s society will accept that . For sure .
B :  And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide .
B :  But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
B :  the modern material we can p select .
B :  And it's practical .
B :  And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something .
B :  And as I said , it's perfect .
C :  .
A :  Okay .
B :  Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an
C :  Experience . Explanat
D :  Such a nice thing .
B :  s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes .
C :  See this .
D :  Can I ? Ho-ho .
C :  You can
D : 
A :  What do you say ?
D :  It says
B :  You must say it .
C :  Spongy .
D :  I will uh
A :  One day . He
D :  I'll buy it . If I if I need so . Hopefully my daughter will like it .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and
D :  Yes , of course . Of c course .
D :  Ah .
B :  That's all I wanted to say . Now it's technical specification by our
C :  Hmm .
B :  colleague .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So
D :  Oh , there is a button missing . Okay . It's in option .
C :  Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Yeah . So function , mm
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
C :  And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . And then , it will say hi .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hey , babe . Bob . Hey Bob .
A :  Bobby . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , hi , and then you can use it .
D :  Okay , that's good .
A :  Hmm . 'Kay .
C :  So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .
A : 
D :  Oh , these are strawberries .
A :  Are colourful . Yeah .
C :  Material , we want to stick to titanium .
C :  We will send , we want to
D :  Fruit smelling spongy titanium . I didn't know it exist , but that's great .
A : 
C :  Yeah , or s
C :  So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
D :  Ha .
A :  Ho-ho .
D :  You mean we can change the colour uh of th
A :  That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
C :  For the L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .
C :  With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah .
D :  Tit titanium is
B :  We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Uh , okay .
C :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , Bob , please . Tuesday colour .
A :  Hey , you know you're theme today .
C :  Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Black for Sunday .
C :  And you can have many colours on weekends . Or
A :  And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ?
D :  On the L_C_D_ ? Oh .
C :  Huh ?
A :  Wh wh
C :  Ah , these are like sensors .
D :  Of course . What do you think ? Strawberry sensors .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That's location sensors .
D :  Very useful .
A :  Okay . Strawberries .
C :  So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
A :  Ah .
D :  Lounge meeting .
C :  So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
B :  Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Good .
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
B :  Oops .
D :  So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .
C :  So , any specific questions for
A :  Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into
D :  It makes sense .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Let's make a party first maybe .
C :  Yeah . Then we can discuss We can
A :  W
A :  Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ?
C :  Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .
D :  So uh , this is
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay . Uh , so
D :  What a design .
D :  It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet
A :  Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .
C :  Yeah .
D :  the evaluation criterion .
A :  Oops .
C :  Fudge .
D :  Yeah . So , evaluation please .
D :  So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . So mm
D :  Uh , next slide , please .
D :  As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .
C :  Yeah .
D :  To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Fancy .
D :  So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  from one to seven
D :  with four in the middle .
C :  Huh .
D :  So ,
C :  Yeah , what's is really
D :  what do you think , is it fancy ?
C :  Uh , it's really
A :  Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy .
D :  It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ?
A :  Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ?
D :  Yeah , of course . What do you think ?
B :  Feel the weight .
D :  Is it
D :  The weight is later . Now we're We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
C :  Yeah . Oh .
B :  Really .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven .
D :  It's uh
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology .
A :  It's in the other . Yeah .
C :  Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So
A :  Two . Let's say two , yeah .
C :  M maybe two .
B :  Two . Two .
C :  Technology .
C :  Yeah . Um
D :  So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ .
C :  And we have L_C_D_ .
C :  So you change colours .
A :  Change colour of t
D :  Change colour , I mean that's very
C :  Useful .
A :  Yeah , I think it's a
D :  Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh
C :  Yeah , yeah . It's silly .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Robustness , uh-huh .
C :  Uh , still we need to cha
D :  So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Let's try .
A : 
A :  Um
A :  The strawberries Oh .
C :  Yeah , it Maybe strawberry .
D :  Oh my god . Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So Not at all ?
B :  No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , we can easily plug it .
D :  It is
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three .
A :  Mm-mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
C :  Useful ?
D :  Useful . Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce .
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Oh , yeah , lets me try .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  What is uh next , please ?
C :  Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main
D :  Uh , it depends on the Okay .
A :  And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah .
C :  You
C :  Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want
A :  Okay , also .
D :  So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
C :  Yeah , um yeah .
A :  You can , by using the
C :  Yeah .
B :  You can .
D :  Directly .
B :  You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
A :  You c push here the the yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  And channel .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You can select .
B :  You select twenty , you select five . That's it .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah mm .
D :  It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah .
D :  That's it's less uh Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . But
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .
D :  So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Seems to be useful .
C :  So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
A :  Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two
C :  so
D :  Both .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Up down or left right . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Up .
A :  Yeah . And which what is that ?
D :  That
B :  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus .
C :  This is jog wheel .
A :  Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
D :  Cool .
A :  Oh oh okay , great .
D :  I would say then uh
A :  Now it's looks us useful . Yeah .
D :  Two or three ? Two or three ? Two .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Two , maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , two .
D :  So size and weight .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ?
C :  Yeah , it's size al almost
C :  Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah .
D :  Uh , and and
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . Not sure if uh she can use it .
B :  Of course .
C :  Heavy . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm .
D :  So , should be okay .
D :  Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Oh .
A :  Uh-oh .
D :  Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . I think it's good . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The case is silver titanium , no ?
A :  Yeah , it's .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Let's imagine .
A :  And what about the strawberries on the top ? I'm not convince . But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh
D :  Yahoo .
D :  Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but uh uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh
C :  So maybe , I think
D :  Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . But this If it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , well
C :  Yeah . Um
A :  Hmm .
A :  I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
D :  Uh-huh . So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .
A :  Yeah .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . So it's Even
A :  Mm-hmm . But the n Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh
C :  These buttons
A :  No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
C :  But it looks really not really good . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and
D : 
A :  It's n no , it's not fancy any more .
A :  Okay .
B :  And
A :  Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what
B :  Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy .
A :  Also .
A :  Okay .
D :  I suggested three . Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite You have good arguments . But
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Sure , sure , just look at it .
D :  Great . Fully adaptable . That's Yeah . So you can fit into your palm , okay . That What else can we need ? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
B :  It's full adaptable .
A :  Wow , that's a
B :  Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
C :  Yeah . You can Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's fudge titanium . You know . Right , yeah . And uh
D :  It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one .
B :  Mm ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Let's go for one .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Now we have to do the average .
C :  Three , three , six , eight , eleven .
D :  Who is good in math ?
B :  It's two point one seven .
D :  Okay . Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . I think we have a good
C :  Hmm .
C :  .
A :  Yeah .
D :  good thing . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So
A :  So it's a good evaluation .
D :  It seems to be good , yeah . We have uh
A :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Yeah mm . Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Yeah . Okay . Thanks .
A :  Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?
D :  Ah-ha .
A :  So , I have an Here . Um
A :  .
D : 
A : 
C :  Energy . Uh , we use bat
D :  So so how many batteries do we need ? One battery ?
C :  One battery . Yep .
A :  Okay , so two .
D :  Good .
D :  Why two ?
C :  Oh , we just need one , I guess .
D :  Say no . No , ne never install .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Two batteries or one ?
A :  Oh .
C :  No , number is one . We need only one battery .
D :  Only one .
A :  Yeah yeah , but the price is two . Oh , number . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .
D :  No , no . But no , no . No , no way .
B :  No , uh you just Number . Yeah .
C :  Number , number .
D :  Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? Good .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Oh .
A :  No , never .
B :  How What what's the limit ?
A :  H
D :  It's twelve bucks .
B :  Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , now Mm-hmm . Check that number also .
D :  Twelve bucks . Twelve and a half , I think .
C :  So we
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , electronics . So
C :  We have sample chip . Uh , like simple chip , yeah . So , yeah . Yeah . Four buttons at least . And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
D :  It's a simple chip ? Simple chip , okay . One .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  And for the
A :  One also .
D :  One or two ? One ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , one to one . Yeah , one .
D :  So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?
C :  Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?
D :  Let's do a single curve .
C :  Oh , is
B :  It's it's flat .
D :  It's flat , and curved .
C :  Oh . Oh , okay .
A :  I thought you can curve somebody .
B :  It's flat .
B :  But it is flat , you Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved .
D :  It's curvable .
D :  Maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? It's only curve ? Okay , let's go .
A :  Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  This Okay , you d We tried , we tried .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me .
C : 
C :  Oh .
B :  Oh , okay .
D :  So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm , that's expensive . Mm-hmm .
C :  Titanium .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . But she wanted u the fudge titanium . I think it's five , but you don't say .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , well
D :  Let's stick to s titan . Special colour ? No because uh
B :  Well , n Why three ? Why three ?
C :  No , only one , no ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um
A :  Special colour , or it's only on the
C :  Interface .
D :  Oh .
C :  Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Ok
A :  Yeah , but there is no colour here . So I put it here .
C :  Yeah , an Yeah .
C :  Push-button .
D :  So the L_C_D_
A :  How many push-button ? Three or two ?
C :  Uh , two .
D :  Two .
A :  Is there The scroll-wheel , okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's going to be expensive .
C :  One scroll wheel . One L_C_D_
C :  displayed .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um
D :  That's all ? No .
A :  That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay .
C :  Yeah , it's cheaper .
A :  Or only a scroll-wheel .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm .
C :  So
D :  You are trying to make make up make us up .
A :  You try to s No , no , no . Because how do you do to y select ?
C :  It's already
D :  No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ?
C :  Ah .
C :  Y ye
A :  Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
D :  That's true .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really
D :  Yeah .
A :  Stay longer . Okay . Oops . Okay , okay . Um
D :  It should stay . Yeah .
C :  Special colours , yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  For buttons .
C :  Yeah , buttons and strawberries . Yeah .
B :  No , buttons just normal .
C :  Special form .
A :  You you have all of these , no ?
D :  She's very hard on this . Special colour ?
A :  Mm maybe n not this one but
D :  Yeah . No . Special material ?
C :  Uh , we have titan
B :  That's for buttons . But buttons are standard .
D :  Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .
A :  Yeah , so
D :  Nothing special . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Not special colours an interest in ?
D :  No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .
A :  And buttons are not colourised ?
D :  I no .
A :  They are m
C :  Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . Yeah , and uh
D :  We can just use this red . It's
A :  Boo-hoo . It's already too expensive . Apparently .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Uh , until we get twelve fifty .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  Oh .
A :  So think of what we can cut uh here .
D :  Well ,
D :  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker .
C :  Sample speaker . Yeah .
A :  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
D :  Yeah .
