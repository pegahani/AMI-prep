A :  So we come again for the the second meeting .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh for the aim of this
A :  now is to
A :  to make presentation about
A :  uh the work for each one .
A :  And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote
B :  Okay .
A :  control . And we have think I got a new project requirement . So I think
C :  Okay .
A :  uh teletext becomes outdated .
A :  So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television .
C :  Okay .
A :  And of course we should have our image
A :  in the in the design .
A :  So , let's start with the
A :  the industrial designer .
C :  Yeah , alright . So uh
A :  .
A :  Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want .
C :  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my
A :  Here .
C :  in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here .
D :  Just go to explorer .
A :  Oh okay .
D :  Or open .
D :  Participant two .
C :  Participant two .
A :  This one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Open uh .
C :  Uh open .
A :  Do you want to open
B :  Because it's open you mean .
C :  Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and
B :  F_ five .
D :  Slide show , view slide show , .
A :  Ah .
C :  And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use .
C :  Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh
C :  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication
C :  So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set .
B :  Did you draw it ?
A :  Wow .
B :  This . What is the other chip for ? The one on top .
A :  This
C :  The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .
D :  One is a communication .
B :  For men .
B :  To the in
B :  Okay .
C :  And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t
B :  Mm .
B :  What is F_P_G_A_ ?
C :  It's field programmable uh something array . Yeah .
D :  Gateway arrays . It's a field programmable gateway arrays .
B :  So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ?
C :  Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .
B :  Yeah . Programme it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
B :  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice
C :  No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .
B :  Okay .
D :  Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . Yeah to run th to make it run . That's it .
B :  Is the is the software par alri okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , okay . So you can control if you want , right ?
C :  Yeah . Alright and that's it for the working design . So if you have any questions ?
D :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?
C :  Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t . Yeah , yeah . And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so
A :  .
D :  Into the more compact and uh okay , .
B :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Okay .
B :  Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's a good idea .
D :  Yeah , that's right . Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . We just make a small charger and put it
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh mm . Y yeah , yeah . Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?
C :  That's a good idea .
A :  You can i yeah .
C :  Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . S okay , so charger for is the .
D :  Bu
B :  I dunno .
A :  Yeah we can change the b .
D :  Our remote , we do not want to make it P_D_A_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  So is mine .
A :  It's mine . Participant one , no ?
B :  Oh .
B :  Yeah , this your
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh we have so let's move to
A :  to user interface design .
B :  Yeah . So you can open uh three .
A :  Participant
B :  Yeah .
B :  So
B :  So I'm working on the technical functions design .
B :  can you show the next slide .
B :  So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah . I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you
A :  During the weekend .
A :  That's good .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  This are usual functionality .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . This is the most competing prototypes I've found . But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons
A :  Tasks .
A :  And they are small .
B :  Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy . So you so you move to the next the next one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Of course .
B :  Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_
B :  Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the
A :  than the
C :  So we have to t
A :  So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too .
A :  Yeah , we don't
B :  Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .
A :  Yeah , I think so . J j just the remote control .
D :  Yeah , not the T_V_s .
C :  I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ?
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , we .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Okay .
A :  Speech recognition .
B :  N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .
C :  Yes , that's a good idea , I think . We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh
A :  Keep the navigation but
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . It's easy to build ,
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  it does not consume much power .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  .
B :  Okay , that's all .
D :  Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .
C :  Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .
C :  Yeah . Maybe you
D :  Uh-huh huh huh huh .
D :  Mm-hmm hmm hmm .
C :  .
B :  If you go by channel , you don't have to do that .
C :  but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could
D :  But
A :  So you are
B :  Ah .
D :  Yeah then yeah that's right .
B :  Ah , a big jump .
B :  A mouse or
C :  Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm hmm hmm . Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But we'll see .
A :  How the this remote ?
B :  Uh it's gonna be small . Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . I dunno how bu
A :  Yeah , of course small .
D :  too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .
D :  Yeah , that's .
D :  just give it a name and we call him . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right .
B :  And responds to you , and
C :  Okay , so uh next presentation
A :  Participant four .
A :  So Harry .
D :  Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that
C :  Mm .
D :  These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology
D :  We already know that as discussed earlier
C :  Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts
D :  An it does how feasible it is .
B :  I- mm . But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary
D :  Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . We just have the
C :  Yeah .
C :  And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  so it's a good idea .
D :  it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim . And next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But
A :  But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility .
D :  I mean we have to look for a trade-off . The features and the cost .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay
A :  Yeah .
D :  Little bit more if it's with extra features .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It
B :  little bit more for comfort , yeah , extra features .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , yeah . That's right .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  But is it useful or not u
C :  Well , uh
A :  I don't know . There is in the
D :  I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .
C :  Well , we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so
D :  Mm , I think
C :  I well it will be alright .
A :  I think i
B :  What is the teletext ?
A :  If it's necessary can you can do that . We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  What about lighting adaptive options ? According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that .
D :  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .
A :  Mm .
B :  So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ?
B :  It's very complex .
D :  I mean
C :  Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too
D :  I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .
B :  Mm .
C :  For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light
D :  I think
B :  Yeah , then we can conclude that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project .
A :  So we have I think we have s still we have
A :  couple of minutes . Mm-mm .
A :  So any things to
A :  to discuss ?
A :  Or any suggestions ?
D :  I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .
D :  The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .
A :  Expensive .
A :  Price .
B :  Mm .
D :  And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . That should be a good uh point .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  .
C :  Function .
C :  Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?
A :  I think we we can we
A :  is the .
C :  Yes .
C :  Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television .
B :  Mm .
C :  Because if
B :  Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand
C :  Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . So if we already have it in our remote control
D :  We already have some .
A :  So you have to anticipate the the future ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The future demand , market demand .
C :  Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  The functionality in the future . Alright .
A :  .
A :  In future .
B :  Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , .
C :  Okay . So
A :  Okay .
A :  So let's go for the the lunch break , and
C :  Okay , thank you .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  we will meet after .
D :  Okay , thank you .
