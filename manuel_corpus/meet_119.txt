A :  Oh .
B :  It's not saved yet .
C :  Okay .
B :  So
A :  Okay .
B :  Our beautiful drawing .
A :  So just f um
A :  So this is our agenda . You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
D :  Oops .
C :  Okay .
A :  Uh I didn't Oh yeah .
A :  So these are the
C :  Oh , okay . Yeah .
A :  So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .
B :  Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
A :  Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .
B :  Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
A :  Okay , just
B :  Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh
C :  Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .
A :  Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
C :  It's probably better .
C :  Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions .
B :  It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
A :  Maybe that's better .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's that's a very good point .
B :  Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
C :  Think that's better .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So this is okay ?
B :  No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
A :  Okay , so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . But um Okay , for the Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So
C :  The
B :  Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .
C :  Ah okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
B :  Good .
A :  So you can show your prototype if you want to .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Together ?
C :  Yeah , it's Let's do it together . Okay .
B :  I'll give comments .
C :  Yeah , we just made a Word file
C :  with the basic
C :  elements .
C :  Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . Uh the material should be hard plastic .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements .
C :  Uh we have
C :  The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . And this is the
A :  Okay , cool .
C :  the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .
A :  Okay .
C :  And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . So you hold it like this in your right hand and
D :  Means
A :  Mm .
A :  So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
B :  Speech recognition .
A :  Yeah , speech recognition . Just Only one button to say it's on or off .
B :  Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Um so I've
C :  Uh I dunno .
C :  Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .
B :  Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
A :  So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
B :  Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .
C :  Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  That's uh
B :  We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But
B :  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
A :  Yeah , you can put it separate .
B :  You Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so .
B :  Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
B :  That was the the most important thing . So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
B :  Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's
B :  will uh will show up .
B :  Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
C :  Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
B :  Okay yeah , they
C :  Mm yeah .
B :  Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . It's uh twelve buttons .
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  just so you get that .
D :  Okay , but
D :  It's rather important .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah okay , just we just missed that . But um I'll just uh
B :  I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular .
B :  Um
B :  The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you
B :  That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
A :  Okay .
B :  So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
B :  Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
B :  Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
D :  Okay .
B :  And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .
A :  And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? How do you want to implement that ? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ?
B :  So when you pre
B :  Yeah .
B :  We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in
A :  Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um
D :  Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be
C :  Okay , maybe we use this button for the
D :  Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .
B :  Yeah , I um To your video device .
A :  Yeah , as well . Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .
C :  Yeah .
C :  A second level ? Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No no , just on Down there . So uh
B :  Is i Ah okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And h how does the second level come out ? Uh it slides uh along ?
A :  Just uh if you s
B :  Um slides I think . It's
A :  Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
D :  From from the uh beneath ?
A :  For the bottom .
B :  You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed .
A :  No , you gotta slide it .
A :  Yeah , it's right .
B :  So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um
C :  So what do we need ?
B :  Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
C :  Yeah , just
D :  Menu ?
B :  Menu button .
B :  With uh maybe uh arrows .
B :  So you can uh
B :  scroll in the , navigate the menu .
B :  Um
C :  God damn it .
D :  Scart ?
B :  I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .
D :  Uh yeah .
D :  And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes .
C :  So this is the
D :  Yeah . It's a f basic uh
B :  If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Extern or something .
A :  You want to save that file as well ?
A :  The drawing ?
B :  That was it .
C :  So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .
B :  Uh
A :  Doesn't really matter . Just just uh
C :  I don't know the functions . Okay . What else ?
B :  It doesn't really matter . That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .
C :  What else ?
C :  Uh menu .
D :  Yeah , to navigate .
C :  Uh With arrows .
B :  S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do .
B :  Mm where do we have
B :  Or there .
C :  Like a normal um
B :  Like on the normal uh Like this .
C :  Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . Okay .
B :  The menu button , yes .
B :  Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .
D :  Mm okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
D :  okay .
A :  Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and
D :  Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  That's that's very easy , yeah .
C :  We can put those here .
D :  Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay . That's uh Um
C :  So did we miss anything ?
B :  Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
D :  It
D :  Some text uh buttons .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
B :  I just uh The volume logo .
A :  No , ma on on o on the on the
D :  there's one there's one text button I
C :  Oh wh Here ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Just make it
D :  There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Do you do you Did you think of that ?
C :  Yeah , or th or the
B :  Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then
B :  Uh why not ?
A :  Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
D :  Ex Yeah . Yeah .
B :  No Whoa
C :  Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the
B :  I think um Yeah , the three stages . Yes .
D :  The sta the state you
A :  Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay .
C :  through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first .
D :  Yeah .
B :  No , it doesn't have to turn it off .
D :  No . Just remember where it was . It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? But maybe it's not the way
B :  Just don't
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes , that's to remember .
C :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah , but that's that's uh
B :  I dunno if
A :  That's a functionality for the television .
B :  Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah .
D :  Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
C :  Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .
B :  Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , but you have to search every time again . That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .
C :  Th i
B :  the chip .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Yeah , I dunno . Okay .
B :  So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or
D :  Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
A :  No , that's what the television does .
C :  Yeah , those memory functions .
D :  But uh not not every every television , so
C :  Yeah . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Okay .
A :  Okay , it's cool .
A :  Yeah , that's fine .
C :  So that's it ?
A :  Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
D :  Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?
C :  Mm . No no Yeah . Just hard plastic . So
B :  Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
D :  Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
A :  It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
B :  I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .
C :  Uh I think just um
D :  Well yeah . That's too much place .
D :  Okay , just leave it . Just leave it .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  I don't think the space is worth it .
D :  Yeah , and i
C :  I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
D :  The most time
D :  Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .
D :  Okay . Fine .
A :  Yeah ? Okay , cool .
A :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
A :  Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
D :  Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . That shall show it .
A :  Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool .
A :  Okay .
A :  You have some usability criteria or Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm . Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh
D :  Oh .
C :  In the bottom .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Look-and-feel ?
D :  Evaluation crit
C :  No , evaluation is
D :  Yeah , evaluation presentation .
D :  It's not in .
D :  Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something .
D :  Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And
D :  The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
A :  Okay .
D :  um model . And this These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . It's
D :  Yes . Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . The LEDs .
B :  Mm .
A :  We are actu We are the
A :  Flashy .
B :  Okay . Well I think we do If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
D :  Yes . And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? Or you haven't thought about
A :  But uh
C :  Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
B :  Hmm ?
B :  Um basic colours , um yeah . Well you didn't say . Maybe um company colours ?
D :  Ho how do we make uh
A :  It's black .
B :  Black .
D :  Black and yellow . Can
B :  A bit a bit of yellow .
A :  Yeah , yellow light . Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . It's
B :  Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow .
D :  Black white , maybe ?
B :  Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
C :  And what colours should the buttons be ?
D :  Uh
D :  Because um
A :  Yeah , different colours . This is
B :  Just um
A :  Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .
C :  But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
B :  Yes .
A :  No , no . Make them No , just make them black or grey or something .
B :  Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .
B :  Well we have changeable fronts , so
D :  Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
B :  So
A :  Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay . It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's ju so subjective .
B :  It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , just give it a two .
D :  A two . Okay .
D :  The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  One more thing . Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? Yeah ?
D :  Slide panel ?
B :  Mm . Not needed .
A :  No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and uh
B :  Yeah , not needed I think .
C :  And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
D :  Oh , you mean th this here ?
A :  That as well , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
B :  What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
D :  It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Of course it's reachable .
A :  It doesn't make
D :  Then we do it .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . Just a green light or some blue light .
A :  No . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
B :  To light it all up .
A :  But Yeah . Mayb Okay .
C :  Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .
A :  Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . So I'll give it a
A :  So
A :  Yeah , that's how I think .
B :  Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so
D :  Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so
A :  Yeah , this It is a one . It's okay . It's cool .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's one .
D :  Okay , next . Learnable ? Easy to use ?
A :  This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the
D :  Yeah , we shall test it But uh
A :  Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . It's That's
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , but you don't have to use that . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit
D :  Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re
C :  Well , I think it is .
B :  Well y just uh f
A :  But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n
B :  Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .
C :  So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
A :  So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
D :  Okay .
D :  But
B :  It's Yeah it's
D :  Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it .
B :  Device .
D :  And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . Because easy to use comes after learnable . I I think it a three or something .
A :  But yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two .
B :  Maybe three then . Learnable's
A :  No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
C :  Mm uh .
C :  The normal . And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know
B :  Yeah okay . Yeah .
B :  Yep , true .
B :  Then a two .
D :  Oh . Okay . New features . Techno technological innovative ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  The speech function and the colour . Colour .
D :  The speech function is new . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
B :  And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
A :  Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a
D :  Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
A :  Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . So that's not new . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Okay .
D :  Okay , and the the the lightning ? Is that new ? The lighting's new . Scrollwheel . Speech ?
A :  That's cool . Yeah for a Uh for a f
C :  Mm it's pretty new , I think .
B :  Yes .
C :  Speech is new .
B :  Different colours , so
D :  Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So we have a pretty new uh
A :  There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . But
B :  That would And we didn't uh
D :  It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
B :  But then we also have the the home station . We are forgetting about that now , but
A :  If you have
A :  Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable .
D :  Uh-oh .
D :  Home-station .
B :  We don't recharge .
C :  Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but
B :  But that's more like uh now .
A :  Yeah , just draw it afterwards .
C :  Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .
B :  I don't know .
A :  If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?
B :  Uh
B :  Just save , save as ?
A :  Yeah . Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project .
C :  Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .
A :  Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Yeah , but this one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  This one is not yet in the Oh oh .
C :  I think it is .
B :  Yeah , it is .
C :  No , I think it is .
B :  Uh untitled ? Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven .
A :  But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not
D :  No , we are not extraordinary new or something . Tha tha that
A :  No , just so it's still a two .
C :  Mm two , I think .
A :  Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ?
D :  No , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yes .
A :  Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group .
D :  Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question .
A :  I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . So you want
C :  Yeah .
C :  We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
C :  think that's a two or a one .
C :  Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy . And I don't thi I don't see
D :  Yeah , this . So we targeted it ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  But we didn't follow the latest trends .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah , you could make a a front
B :  Mm . I think we followed the latest trends .
C :  a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something .
D :  Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer .
B :  Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . You can different front uh
A :  Yeah , you get different colours .
D :  Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh
A :  So
C :  Like a a f banana kind of front .
D :  Oh yeah . But spongy will never be .
C :  No .
D :  So we give ourself a three or something .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  So that's eleven .
D :  That's uh
D :  What's the average ?
A :  It's Yeah , it is one point eight three .
C :  Eleven divided by six .
D :  A perfect score . No , I don't know .
C :  We're not too hard on ourselves .
B :  This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .
C :  Okay .
D :  And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .
C :  Okay .
B :  To call . Um
A :  Oh yeah , that's still
D :  Call
C :  Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep .
A :  Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one .
B :  Okay .
D :  That's Yeah , but it
B :  No no , I want that in .
C :  But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .
D :  No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable .
C :  If you do uh
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  It's uh
A :  So I just got a financial um
B :  Yes uh .
A :  You s saved it or
D :  Yeah .
D :  I did save it .
A :  No .
A :  Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me .
A :  It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .
C :  Mm okay .
D :  That's fine .
C :  But uh is uh uh
A :  So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
C :  Okay .
A :  So that's both .
D :  Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three .
A :  Yeah , and single curved curved .
C :  But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or
A :  No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be .
C :  Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ?
B :  Yeah , we can uh
A :  Probably . I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure .
B :  Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .
A :  See it's I think it's okay like this .
D :  Special form , yeah .
A :  It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So you can put a recharger in it as well . But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
C :  Yeah .
B :  This ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's four .
D :  Four . It's four Euros .
B :  Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it .
D :  Yeah . So we are
A :  Yeah , that's included .
C :  It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . Because
A :  Yeah , no . Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Damn , solar cells are uh expensive .
A :  So I just want you Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh
A :  for everything together .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?
C :  Sure .
D :  Yes .
B :  Okay .
A :  Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?
C :  Beautiful .
B :  Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh already . So
C :  Yeah m If we got a high mark for um
C :  uh innovativeness or innovativity
A :  Yeah .
D :  Or a different style .
C :  then there we probably have been creative .
B :  I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
A :  Okay , so the leadership
A :  Was there a leadership and
B :  Of course there was .
A :  Okay .
A :  What do you have to say about that ?
C :  No , I think Yeah .
D :  Who was the leader ?
A :  I dunno .
C :  Just normal discussion , I think . Not
B :  Yeah .
C :  one leader or something .
B :  One leader to
B :  check the time , etcetera .
C :  Yeah . And make notes .
A :  Yeah , I know .
B :  So more like a secretary .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , next one . Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . We're not finished .
D :  Yeah yeah . We were not finished .
C :  Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just
D :  Uh .
B :  Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , th that's weird .
D :  Yeah , because
D :  the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . And then
B :  Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it . We had to
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm hmm yeah .
A :  Yeah , finance .
C :  So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But the teamwork was okay .
D :  Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh
B :  I think uh everyone listen to each other . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . No .
D :  Yeah .
B :  It was Just doesn't work . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Just not work too slow . Yeah , more accurate .
D :  Digital pen or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
D :  Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
B :  Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .
D :  Precise .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Not just pointing out on it .
A :  It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . And so you've
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .
B :  No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , like .
B :  Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  And it's far too slow this way .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .
C :  No .
A :  I think Yeah , okay .
D :  Digital pen .
A :  So we made it in time . And we made a remote control .
B :  We did it .
A :  In the budget , yeah .
B :  New ideas found .
D :  New ideas .
C :  What's that ?
B :  Oh
D :  For for for
A :  I don't know what it mean . Just
B :  I just think if we uh
D :  To gather , or to uh
D :  work together , uh or new ideas for
B :  I dunno .
A :  For remote control probably . No , for the project .
B :  For remote control , a favourite for your text .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No , for the prototype . New ideas .
C :  Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and
A :  Yeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that .
C :  Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .
B :  That's for .
B :  Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the
C :  Yeah , just brainstorming basically .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Details uh
D : 
C :  So are we finished ?
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yes , I think just I just write a final report .
C :  Okay . Yeah .
B :  Quite early .
A :  No , we have only
A :  four minutes left . Uh it's okay .
C :  Oh okay .
B :  Oh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh

B :  One two three
B :  four five six seven cameras .
B :  Mm not bad .
B :  So that was it .
C :  Yeah . Now we can look at this .
B :  This is
C :  We're probably not supposed to look at this , but
B :  The old versions .
C :  Yeah , from the previous group .
B :  They went for uh
B :  for a universal device . Yeah , but also a different device .
C :  The touchscreen , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Here are the
C :  basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices .
B :  Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . I do agree with that .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , tu-dum .
B :  English is not so hard by the way .
C :  No .
D :  I'm breaking a world record here .
B :  Well , leader ?

B :  You do ? Yeah , you have to make a choice .
