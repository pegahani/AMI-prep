D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , almost there .
C :  Okay . We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess . How was that , was that fun ?
D :  Mm . Very fun .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . Upsidaisy . Um Um we Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
B :  E excuse me I forgot my
C :  Alright , okay , yeah .
B :  copy .
C :  He's gonna get his pen .
D :  Oh right . Okay .
C :  Um Will you guys first with your prototype
C :  um before we get to the good news ?
A :  Yeah , there's good news ? Oh .
C :  Uh we have budget problems .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh .
C :  I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . I don't even have this on .
A :  Cutbacks .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show .
A :  Okay .
B :  No , not mine yet .
A :  Oh .
A :  Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah .
D :  Okay . Sure .
A :  Okay .
D :  We made three for you .
C :  Three ? Oh .
D :  Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st
C :  Tomato ? What tomato ? I don't recall a tomato .
D :  Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition .
C :  Ah I see , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Logo .
C :  Okay , brilliant .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .
C :  Alright , okay .
C :  Right .
C :  That's groovy .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .
B :  Uh can I have
D :  Yeah , sure . Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate .
B :  Oh sorry s
C :  At Oh dear .
D :  That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan .
C :  Alright , okay .
C :  Okay , brilliant mm .
C :  Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah .
D :  Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that .
D :  Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed .
C :  Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .
C :  Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of
D :  Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um and um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . We used those . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place .
C :  Alright , excellent .
C :  Okay .
C :  No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so .
C :  Excellent .
D :  So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too .
A :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  Yep .
A :  This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .
C :  Okay , so so Barney the banana .
A :  A a more friendly type of
A :  Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or
C :  Ah excellent , just what we need .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Say it for the camera .
C :  Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right , right .
C :  Cool yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . 'Kay and
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
D :  So are there any um improvements or issues or
A :  It won't stand .
C :  Oh there are issues , oh there are issues .
A :  Just let it lie down , it wont stand .
C :  Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
D :  Oh .
C :  Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um unfortunately
C :  the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .
B :  Mm .
D :  Oh .
C :  So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . There we go .
A :  What's on the uh on the left ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Oh god , why is it doing that ?
D :  Ooh .
C :  There we go . So basically , um in order to save our two Euros
C :  um I was thinking
C :  that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
D :  Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control .
C :  Um .
C :  Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I don't know what's going on with this again .
A :  W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
C :  Oh , good point .
B :  And double curve on both sides ?
C :  Um .
B :  Curve . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It This one is single curve .
C :  That's sort of curve in and out .
A :  Is i
A :  Mm .
B :  'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides .
B :  So double-curve .
C :  No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though .
D :  Like an S_ shape .
D :  Okay .
B :  Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm .
C :  I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .
D :  Okay .
C :  A curvature is like the this case .
B :  Maybe .
A :  'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . got two of them
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however .
A :  Okay . Well we can work around that um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Right . No .
A :  Cut things out .
A :  But you think it should be one .
C :  It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again .
A :  Okay .
C :  No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Should
C :  Oh that's fine .
A :  Yeah , so we're
C :  Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
D :  Cool .
D :  Cool .
C :  Um
D :  So we could even add something .
C :  We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ?
A :  We should fire the accountants .
A :  Fire the accountants .
C : 
A :  Ah yeah , we could add things .
A :  Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know .
B :  Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute .
C :  It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know .
B :  Okay . No input , like this . Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?
C :  No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something .
A :  Is it the other shift button maybe ?
C :  No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway .
A :  Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Cancel . Piss off .
A :  That's too bad .
C :  Oh well , never mind . Um .
C :  Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ?
D :  Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now .
C :  Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ?
C :  Are we happy ?
A :  Oh .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
C :  Okay .
C :  Evaluation .
C :  Oh we've been writing this up for m months .
D :  I think it went quite smoothly .
C :  Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
D :  W I think we were very creative .
C :  No , I mea I think it means sort of individually .
D :  Oh right , okay .
C :  Yes , no , maybe ? Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry .
D :  Mm-hmm .

A : 
B :  Yeah , we
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  These pens are are neat though .
B :  Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . At le Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm 'kay . Groovy . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . Uh . I suppose yeah . Um .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Okay . Well um .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right .

B :  So
C :  Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable .

C :  Okay .
B :  Uh is the project evaluated , that is mine .
C :  Doesn't tell me .

B :  Yeah .
C :  We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  Mm , love to eat that now . Kind of a green banana now .
A :  Anybody
C :  Mm .
A :  Clay covered banana .
D :  It's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . I've got .
C :  O okay , hold on .
A :  blue .
C :  I wonder w which cell do I want .
A :  It's fun to touch .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So . Yeah .
C :  Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit .
B :  So .
D :  Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you .
B :  So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sorry . Sorry , carry on .
B :  Yeah . So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So
B :  Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ?
B :  the user requirem I think .
A :  Do we have the uh the marker for the board ?
C :  Uh .
D :  Um .
B :  Thank you .
A :  There it is .
B :  So .
B :  So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um I think
D :  Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So .
C :  Yeah .
C :  When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet .
B :  So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh .
D :  I would say seven . Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't True or false ? No sorry tr one is true .
C :  One , yeah .
B :  Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth
A :  No that's false .
B :  Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?
D :  Okay , so one .
D :  Yep .
A :  Uh .
A :  It's hard to know . I I give it a two .
B :  Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um .
A :  But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .
A :  Um I'm gonna give it a two . Two .
B :  Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . So .
C :  Oh , I'll go for a one .
C :  Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
C :  Yeah th
D :  Mm yellow .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  Come on that was the tha
C :  'Kay .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Okay .
C :  Being fruitist .
D :  Is that no is that not trends ?
B :  Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product .
B :  Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . So we can
D :  No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to
D :  Okay .
C :  He's a tough cookie .
B :  Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe .
B :  Three or four ? Uh , no sorry , it should be
C :  Six . Five or six .
D :  What are we doing ?
B :  No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends .
A :  What are we doing ?
D :  Adding them up ?
A :  We're gonna average them ?
A :  Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight .
D :  Oh .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Oh I see .
A :  Yeah round it up to two . So trends .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
B :  Sorry ?
A :  How it how conforms to the current trends ?
B :  Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine .
B :  Okay . Yeah . Uh
A :  'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons ,
A :  um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
D :  Mm .
A :  for technology .
C :  Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might
C :  it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen . So we can Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well it was yellow .
D :  Um .
D :  Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy
D :  two .
B :  Okay .
A :  Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ?
D :  Okay . Is it ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  Okay , so
D :  one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I'll go with two .
B :  So what about you , Brian ?
C :  Um yeah , a three .
C :  Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a
C :  a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six
A :  So one and a half .
D :  Yeah , one .
B :  half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven .
A :  A two .
B :  Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
C :  Cool , groovy .
B :  Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah .
C :  Cool .
D :  Woo-hoo .
C :  Brilliant .
C :  In which case we are done .
C :  'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .
A :  Okay .
D :  Cool .
B :  So yeah . Great .
C :  Champagne lunch anyone ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
