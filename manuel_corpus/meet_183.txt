B :  And something to fidget with .
B :  Okay .
B :  See
A :  Right .
B :  On your marks , get set , go .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Right .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Such a long time since I've done these .
D :  Did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation , did you have had stages of clarification or I suppose you did , right ? Mm-hmm .
C :  We did , yeah .
B :  At the beginning we did . Um
B :  we did a training set , didn't we , and then compared to see
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we did two of those , didn't we ?
B :  we probably did .
C :  I think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And supposedly decided on things . And then we did th all the rest of them separately .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So did you feel that it was some some kind of some process of convergence , like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and and markations and then eventually you came up uh with some kind of rules that you set up between uh the two of you ? Or
B :  Yes , I think . Okay . Yeah , but you convinced me .
C :  I'd say no , but I d I mean I thought we had basically the same ideas to b I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah .
B :  No , that's true . Mm-hmm .
B :  It's the length of it really .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But we had
C :  And what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral feature , and we had a long discussion about that . But I don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging , just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do .
B :  That's really hard , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we we had a manual , which we haven't got here . Do you reckon if we get a copy , would that be useful ?
C :  It probably would be , but I don't i it's been a long time , yeah , since we've done this .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started ?
B :  Can we get Ben to print us out one ?
D :  Yeah , I think so . Okay . I dropped a . So did Dere Derek and Ben has the um the file that they this manual ? Or
C :  Yeah , that would be handy . Sign off .
B :  Mm . Okay . Yes , now we're moving with the headphones .
A :  Yeah .
C :  We did send it to him , yeah .
A :  He has had it certainly . Yeah . Yeah , he's been emailed it while ago .
B :  Yes , he's he's been e emailed it , yeah . Otherwise we can go onto our system and get it .
D :  Yeah ? O okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now he's gone .
C :  There's a cool little count-down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well .
B :  Yes . Let's say something rude .
A :  Oh really ?
A :  Excellent .
B :  I oh . top .
A :  We should have these things in our area . You know , we don't have high-tech things . Well , I guess there's telescopes , but that that's that's different though , isn't it . That's not no .
B :  But no , how little work we did .
C :  No , we don't at all .
B :  I'm doing that at yes .
C :  Yeah . But they're hardly in our areas . Uh
B :  Yeah . They have got a
B :  conference thing , haven't they ?
B :  In the A_T_C_ .
A :  Yeah , that's right , although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days , I think .
B :  I had to fly to Germany to do a teleconference , the same as you did for the interview . And they fly you to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with three people in Chile . And had they asked , we could have done it fine at A_T_C_ and saved me having to to go to Germany for a day . But
C :  Yeah , I did as well .
A :  Gosh .
A :  Right , aye .
C :  No .
A :  Right . Gosh .
B :  they haven't got that far .
C :  It's a very strange interview feeling as well , because you can't see them while you're giving your talk , because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them , but during the talk part they have a camera on I believe them , 'cause I could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk . And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were , and so you forget that they can see you at all , and so when all that was over , they were answering me questions and the view switched again , I realised they were sitting there in the interview going . So
B :  Mm .
A :  And you miss all the the body language and things . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Right .
A :  Right .
B :  And mine was even it was different again . W we had it was a four-way split screen with me and three other people , and it just stayed like that . And I had the talk on a laptop in front of me and they had the talk on their laptops , and I had to tell tell them when to press the button to turn the page . It just
A :  Right .
A :  Right .
A :  Oh . Right . Gosh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And you can't say looking over here . Like o
B :  Yes , if you see towards the top left of the image , you'll notice And luckily Olivia had warned me it might be complicated , and so I had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things , because that would just make it really difficult . But I practised the talk , yeah , standing up in front of it and pointing to things , and you're sitting down in front of And you could see yourself , but not only could s you see yourself , you see yourself bounce back two seconds later .
A :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's very artificial though , isn't it ? Yeah . Not very sensible . Yeah , right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  That must be really weird . Is there ? Gosh .
B :  By the time the signal had gone to Chile and back . So you're like oh , did I just do that ? And then you reacting to what you did a while ago . It was a really daft situation .
C :  Yeah . It is really strange .
A :  Yeah . Gosh . Well Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Okay , right , it's printing it out as well .
B :  Lovely .
A :  Great .
C :  Excellent .
B :  And then we can start fighting about
C :  Right . Shall w shall we dive in in the interim ? Or
B :  Yes , let's .
B :  Continuum flux or continuum .
B :  Mm . Yes .
C :  Mm .
B :  Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature . I think it should probably just be continuum .
B :  If it was continuum luminosity , you probably wouldn't it . Ooh .
C :  No , you wouldn't do . I think I'm do I think I'm working out who's top and bottom . Um
C :  Yeah , I'm happy enough with that . I don't feel strongly about it .
B :  Okay , it's my part .
D :  I actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking , who's top and who's bottom . I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know . I don't know .
B :  Oh .
C :  Ah . Ben said he he left it out on purpose , which is reason
B :  I think I think we've worked
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , and I'm pretty sure I'm bottom anyway . So even on one we can tell .
C :  Yeah . I'm pretty sure I'm top . Uh
D :  Okay , fair enough .
B :  'Cause I would fight for line being a spectral feature as well .
C :  Right .
C :  Right . Yeah , I think that's probably right as well .
B :  It's a bit hard to mark on this . Let's do that .
C :  Okay , next .
D :  So so you sorry , um just for the convention , you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one . Okay , fair enough .
B :  The ones we want .
B :  Yes . And if neither , then we'll have to put something else .
D :  Mm-hmm , okay .
C :  Okay . So here we're missing soft component on the bottom .
B :  And I think you're probably right , soft component is a spectral feature .
C :  There .
C :  If you get line I get soft component .
B :  Ooh . Well , if you don't No . Yeah , go ahead .
A :  Do you think ? Sorry , I I shouldn't intervene probably . But well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u
C : 
A :  and we can point at it . And then it is a sp a sp spectral f f
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  feature , and that isn't
C :  You can point to a soft component .
B :  You can point to a soft component .
A :  You think ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , alright . Okay . Okay , okay .
C :  It's a big bump in the soft bit .
B :  Is it ?
B :  Uh , now is a feature part of spectral feature ?
B :  I think you're right there as well .
C :  It c uh yeah , I'm not fussed about that . They both mean the same thing .
B :  'Cause it it's not just absorption . But it's not just absorption point five K_V_ . It is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing .
B :  If it was a
B :  a dip in absorption or a
C :  Yeah . This is the this is the thing you point to , yep . Yeah , that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism . So yeah , I'd say
B :  a lack of absorption , you would put it in , because we said we would put describing words .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Two down . Two hundred and fifteen to go . Excellent .
B :  you would get a pencil .
B :  That's two .
C :  Mm that's definitely two . You're right .
B :  Ah , there's one with the equivalent width . I think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width , but we were gonna mark the lines .
C :  I think that's true .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Alrighty .
C :  What are we missing ? Broad line . Yeah , that's true . You get that .
B :  Broad line . And that should be a And nebulae .
C :  Uh
B :  As a source type .
C :  I don't remember what we were doing with nebulae .
C :  We weren't doing like H_ two regions and stuff , were we ?
B :  I can't remember . Should we see when the manual comes . So let's come back to that one . Um
C :  I can't remember actually .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  Yes .
B :  I what we're doing about that either .
C :  Mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes , in which case I'd argue for elliptical I think .
B :  Select a
B :  Yeah , that seems reasonable .
C :  My God , I've just gone mad with the underlining here .
B :  Yes . Um
C :  Yeah , I .
B :  Breaking the power law index , I think that's probably a you can point to it , but equally it's not a it's something you've derived .
C :  Yeah , that's the thing , but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah .
C :  The parallel index is something you desi derive . A break in a spectrum is something you can point at . So
A :  Yeah .
B :  So what's a breaking a power-law index ?
A :  I think it's a feature . Um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that . So it yeah . That's that is where it breaks . So yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
C :  Yeah , b that thing there .
B :  Okay .
B :  Slight depression of the continuum near the Lyman limit . I think you're right there as well .
C :  And if I did it again , I'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well , 'cause you can see both the slight depression and the Lyman limit . But we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features . So
B :  But we're supposed to say w
B :  Yeah , i if it was absorption at H_ alpha , that would all be one . Or absorption at five thousand nanometres would all be one anyway ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature , whereas here they're two spectral features . There's a Lyman limit , which you could see , and then there's a slight depression near it . But
B :  because it was at a certain point .
B :  But this is near .
B :  Yeah , I think you're right . It's it's near rather than at . It's not
C :  Yeah .
B :  . Let's mark that then .
C :  Do you have a sense about that ?
A :  Oh , you want to s split that one and , do you , into two ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh I'd agree with that , I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Is that K_ clear ? Oh . .
C :  Excellent .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Mm absorption .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  That I didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption .
B :  Yes , and you're right there as well .
C :  Not the the thing .
B :  Tell you who's more awake at this .
D :  Would there be other cases where you would actually mark an ab absorption ? Or
B :  Mm-hmm . An absorption feature .
C :  Yeah , if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave-length . But when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed , that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff . So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Cheers . Yeah .
A :  Thanks .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Thank you .
C :  So
C :  Thank you .
B :  There is no steep soft component but our two K_V_ .
C :  I don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there .
B :  Mm .
C :  It's not something you can point to .
C :  You could point to it if it were there .
B :  Yes , you could . I tend to miss out things if they're too long .
B :  Um
A :  But if it had been there , um you would've
B :  You would point to it . Yeah . Yes , I think you're right .
C :  Marked it , yeah .
A :  had it as a feature .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Should we go back to number five ?
D :  Is that the nebula ?
C :  Huh ? Oh yeah . Yeah . What were we saying about nebula ? Source types .
B :  But yes , nebula . Mm-hmm .
D :  Was it the nebula thin Yeah .
C :  No , nebula counts , doesn't it ?
B :  I think it does . We weren't matching a H_ two regions , because it was a region I think was the argument for that .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Line again . Line in ratios . But I remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios , but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of H_ beta orbited .
C :  Yeah , but that's line ratios .
C :  But
B :  Ratio is different I guess . Mm .
C :  Uh , line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios . It isn't it ? It's it's not talking about specific lines . A line ratio is a thing .
B :  I guess it's similar .
A :  Yeah , because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it .
C :  Right .
B :  Don't include
A :  L line ratio is after abundances .
A :  So
B :  Is that the value or is that the word ?
C :  . Yeah .
A :  Oh , I see what you mean . Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Don't it in include the derived property ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah , I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths . Yeah , it shouldn't be in .
A :  Well
A :  No .
B :  You wouldn't include line in that ? Okay . .
C :  I don't think . Whoop , no . Oh , I see what you're doing , you're circling the one we like , right .
B :  The one to keep , yeah .
B :  Damped Lyman alpha absorbers , I think that's a spectral feature even though it's
B :  You wouldn't mark the source type .
C :  Oh sorry , um yep .
D :  Um so so can I just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry , you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't
B :  Here .
B :  Yes , because we don't want it underlined . It shouldn't be highlighted . So . Yeah . M
D :  Right , sorry . Ok oh , I see , okay . Mm-hmm .
C : 
C :  Uh right , damped Lyman see again , that's uh these are source types , the um I mean it's not a source type . B
D :  Cheers . I see .
B :  Mm-hmm . But it's also a I i if we have
C :  But damped Lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things , not spectral features .
B :  But th but you also absorb them by Y you observe them by their spectral feature . What were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example . We were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar .
B :  So I think it should be the same as that . If it's defined by a spectral feature , we should mark it .
C :  Ye
C :  But uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped Lyman alpha absorber , unless you'd
B :  Here .
B :  You could point to damped Lyman alpha though .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Because it says here , spectral features we're now referring to a type of source , E_G_ quasar .
C :  Yeah , you could do .
C :  But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source .
B :  Um not a bis specific type of source , but I think still the the spectral feature ge counts , even though it's m a modifier of something .
C :  Okay . I'm not certain about that , but I
B :  What do you reckon , Bob ?
C :  Hmm .
A :  Um
A :  Well , I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped. .
C :  But
A :  That is a n spectral feature .
C :  D don't with damped Lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight ? So you have to know
A :  Oh yeah . No , that's true .
B :  How does it work ? I don't know what which doesn't help .
C :  If you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way , you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah , that's a damp yeah . They're gonna be at different red-shifts .
A : 
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Different redshifts . Yeah yeah yeah , that's true .
B :  Y ye
B :  But that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped Lyman alpha and that's damped Lyman alpha .
C :  I don't know how they do th that . But
A :  Yeah , but
B :  You could say all of that is damped Lyman alpha .
A :  But you're guessing in a way though , aren't you ? So
C :  Yeah .
B :  But isn't that j always the case with something that's not particularly
C :  Well no , but you see them in all sorts of different red red-shifts . It's like the the Lyman alpha forest , sort of .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And I'm not certain I would
C :  I would mark that .
A :  Mm that's a that's a tricky one , certain certainly .
C :  It's a tricky one .
B :  It it if it was if it was some other spectral feature and then absorbers ,
B :  would we mark it ?
C :  Um no , I wouldn't , because it's they're physical things , not spectral features . You can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped Lyman alpha some I g and I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type , and we wouldn't mark that source type .
B :  But
B :  But we include modifiers of source types we would mark . We're not marking absorbers . But if it was a damped Lyman alpha quasar .
A :  Wouldn't you ?
C :  We wouldn't mark absorbers , no .
A :  Wouldn't you have all of it ?
B :  then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped Lyman alpha . If it was broad absorption line quasar , we'd mark it . Yeah . So it's just I guess whether damped Lyman alpha is a spectral feature
A :  Right , well th yeah , th that's in the the manual . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  in itself . Which I would probably say it was , but then I've never looked at i one .
C :  Hmm it's tricky one .
A :  I g I guess it is .
C :  Okay .
A :  And that it is altering the spectrum , isn't it ? I mean is a ch
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  change in the s spectrum of
C :  Okay .
B :  It doesn't have to be something that's specific . I guess y you know , we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum . And we include those .
A :  background objects .
C :  But we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting , were we ?
B :  That true , but w we have included c power law though . Well no , we included p steep soft component , sorry . And here we included breaking the power law , because of the break .
A :  Uh is that right ?
C :  Have we ?
C :  Steep soft component . Yeah , breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of . Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say , there it is . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . But there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep , you're saying . You know , what's steep and what's shallow .
C :  It's tricky .
B :  Let's have that for now then . You if if we change our mind later when we go through , we can always come back to it and say
C :  Yeah . That's grand . Yeah . Yes .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No .
C :  Um again I'd say this this is a physical process , not a spectral feature .
B :  Yeah , you're right .
C :  Uh
B :  And absorption again .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right , what have we got different here ?
C :  Uh I don't have K_ star , but I should do .
B :  Hmm . It's
B :  Yeah , it's that one and this one here . Oh , we were including feature within spectral feature .
C :  Wait , where
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  What's wrong with broad H_ alpha ?
B :  I think I just missed it . I think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum , it's still the s the line within it .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  That was easy .
B :  Silicone two is an element rather than a
B :  In this context .
B :  Rather than a line . These are the lines .
B :  I guess what you w
B :  If wasn't in there , then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the I think that means silicone two derived from these two features .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think so too in that
B :  Okay .
A :  That's actually an ionic species , isn't it actually ? Not a a spectral feature as such o on its own .
C :  Yeah , that's true , yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  Lyman alpha forest clouds .
C :  Oh no , we're back to it again .
B :  Lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum .
C :  That's true , but Lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking .
B :  So we haven't basically , we just haven't got a a rule for
B :  spectral features within or referring to s types of source when we're not bother marking the source .
C :  Which we don't mark , yeah .
C :  But we can just be consistent .
B :  So are we marking H_ two and H_ two regions , for example ?
C :  And I don't think we are , 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at . Yeah .
B :  Oh , that's true . But b yeah , but I guess it's not it's not defined by a spectral feature though , H_ two region , whereas
A :  No .
B :  Lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of Lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have Lyman alpha forests .
C :  But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum , whereas a broad line quasar , someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line .
B :  But someone's l someone's looked at that spectrum .
C :  But if you're discussing Lyman alpha forest clouds , they could just be discussing the physical object , which we aren't marking .
A :  B b why aren't you marking it then ?
C :  Because they weren't I don't know .
B :  I don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or
D :  The the
C :  Anything blobby I di I didn't mark . Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Um
D :  I it it wouldn't count as a source type ? Or
A :  Well , that's p what I'm p pondering really . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  I w I remembered not marking nebula or clouds or
B :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , but this is um species of cloud , it's a p
C :  Yeah .
A :  a particular species of cloud , not just a general cloud , isn't it ? So isn't that different ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  It's a modifier of of clouds , but I don't th don't think if we're including the
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think if we're not including nebula and clouds , we can't include
C :  I think we just have to decide whether we're doing it .
C :  Yeah , but Bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds .
B :  Perhaps we should've done .
C :  But we haven't for the whole thing .
B :  But we haven't done for the whole thing . So I think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission .
A :  Okay , th
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Then I guess not then . Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
B :  But then we still have to decide if we don't label the source , what do we do about the spectral features that define that source ?
B :  I if we have for example broad absorption line object , we mark that . We mark broad absorption line in that .
C :  But that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it .
B :  It's an but just to know this is a Lyman alpha forest cloud , we're seen Lyman alpha forest .
C :  Uh
A :  And
A :  But it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though . It it isn't the spectrum of the clouds . Yeah .
B :  But it's still a spectral feature , even if it's not it might be a spectral feature i not in the cloud , but it a spectral feature in the quasar , the Lyman alpha forest .
A :  That is true . Uh and he could point at it , that's true , and say that is
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Let's keep them .
B :  Okay . Even if not marked .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No one else can read that , sorry . Okay , so th Lyman alpha forest again .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Nope . And here .
C :  Yep .
B :  And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own then , 'cause it doesn't even say Lyman alpha forest clouds .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Each helium two optical depth , I think that's elemental species .
C :  There , that's derived , you're right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh . Oh , we marked the same lines .
C :  Oh , rubbish . Excellent .
B :  What have we done differently ?
C :  Uh you've got line brightness temperatures .
B :  'Cause the property of the line . They're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these . And we weren't using line
C :  Yeah . Yeah , we are .
B :  What was the one we didn't do before ? Line ratio we weren't doing .
C :  Yeah , I don't think line brightness temperatures counts .
C :  'Cause it's not talking about a specific line .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So Yeah .
B :  Was talking about l lines , okay .
C :  I don't think that counts .
B :  Line feature , need that .
C :  Feature . Right .
D :  Um sorry , can we just go back th uh one page ? Did did you resolve the the li the different um segmentations , like uh the main problem was
C : 
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There's only one difference here .
D :  Oh sorry , I I thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry . No no , I I se okay , sorry . Yeah , I see .
C :  Oh , no . Yeah , they're all the same .
B :  No , no , they are the same otherwise . Quite impressively . That one's the same .
C :  Yes , excellent . Um damped Lyman alpha again .
C :  Systems .
B :  And damped Lyman alpha data .
A :  Uh yeah .
C :  That's a modifier of data .
B :  I can't even but if you said
C :  I mean that's that's a description of the type of data . A d
B :  If you said the spectral dat
B :  The continuum's spet mm .
C :  I really don't think that counts .
B :  But if it's a damped Lyman alpha spectrum , you'd mark damped Lyman alpha , because in the spectrum . And and a da is equivalent of spectrum .
C :  I wouldn't , but you would .
C :  I think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase , you wouldn't for example , when we were saying silicone two levels , we didn't mark silicone two .
C :  That's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum .
B :  That's because it was talking about s but if it's saying silicone two line .
B :  Levels the new word .
C :  But what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped Lyman alpha measurements , and they tell us this answer . And this answer is inconsistent with that answer . Yeah , I don't think that's right .
B :  I think you're probably right in the case of it being data .
C :  Hmm ?
A :  I'm not sure actually . I th I think I would mark it .
A :  And
B :  Mm .
A :  And that it
A :  It is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum
B :  Well
A :  as the data . Um
B :  If it's an emission line data
A :  But if you both want not to mark it , then fine , don't mark it .
B :  Mm . If it's an emission line data , would we put it in ?
C :  I wouldn't , but because it's a modifier of data .
B :  But if it just said em but if it just said emission line , we would .
B :  It the emission line is strong . The emission line data shows strong .
C :  .
B :  Then uh I think it's the same actually , I th I think it's data isn't even needed .
B :  It's inconsistent with the damped Lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent . Or the damped Lyman alpha feature , if you put feature there rather than data , then you'd mark it . But I think data is equivalent if
C :  Oh feature , absolutely . B but
D :  So from the perspective the named entity recognition task , so I th I think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something uh is sitting under a negation , right , the there was no um damped L_ Y_ alpha something , then um we then I think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that . Right , so it's more like uh a s it's uh uh it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality , which I mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so , then you'd probably be right in this case , right . But uh th given that the kind of thing is that that this named entity recogn task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing . Like really just fin finding these kind of strings . I think in this case um I w I would say this is probably an entity . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . That's think enough .
C :  Okay .
B :  Given that we can argue about it for ten minutes , it's probably not that clear-cut .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
B :  Damped Lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them . It should be damped Lyman alpha
C :  Take it again , but systems should be out . Yeah .
B :  in red , whatever that is . Spectral feature .
B :  And that shouldn't be there at all .
C :  Mm 'kay . You've done it again .
B :  And I've done it twice .
B :  Is that clear enough ?
C :  Yes .
C :  Right . Source type .
B :  Flat spectrum
C :  Did we have a rule about this ?
B :  We were including modifiers , including broad line quasars , non broad line quasars as well . So I think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your q with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yep , that's true . That is true .
B :  We're ten percent of the way there .
C :  Are we ? Excellent .
C :  Just hitting the half an hour mark .
A :  You have to s speed up . We'll go p could be here all day .
B :  Continua .
B :  Oh gosh , it will be here forever . Remarkably soft ionising continua .
B :  You're right though , I think . Or or continuum .
C :  See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum . So I don't like that one .
B :  The absorbed continuum . Mm-hmm , yes .
B :  Oxygen shouldn't be there . That's not observed .
C :  Oxygen abundance . Yeah .
B :  Heavy element absorption lines I think should be there .
C :  Mm .
C :  I'm happy enough with that .
B :  Now what else is different ?
C :  Blue-shifted . that's okay with me , I don't care .
C :  Yeah , you can have that as well .
B :  Mm . Oh , thank you . And that one .
C :  There you go .
C :  Next .
C :  Uh
B :  You're right , star-forming galaxies are distinct .
C :  I think they are .
C :  I don't know why I did that . I don't like that at all .
B :  That's , yeah , derived . Probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour .
C :  Yeah , could be that I was a bit sleepy . Lines from ions ?
C :  You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else .
B :  You mean that ?
C :  Well , you'd know where they are in the
C :  Well I guess yeah , I dunno . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . That's true .
B :  If it was lines from H_ two you'd mark it .
C :  That's true . Alright .
B :  Blue wing flux . What were we gonna do about flux ?
B :  Doesn't say .
C :  Yeah , but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature , we'd mark feature . Hmm .
B :  Yes , it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing . So I'm happy with that .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Line peak .
B :  I think that should be marked . Even though it's talking about increasing line peak , it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing .
B :  Should actually be excess blue wing flux .
C :  Possibly . Don't know .
B :  Anyway .
C :  Ah uh
B :  I think line peak is something you can point to .
C :  You can point to it , but can you point to a line peak velocity shift ?
A :  Well I y
B :  No , but you can't you can't s also point to increa increasing blue wing .
A :  Yeah , I don't think you can .
C :  Well you can point to blue wing flux , 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux . But if the line peak is increasingly shifted , you'd
B :  What
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , uh I don't think that's a feature .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm there's a system issue again , so we should be consistent and keep it . Right ?
B :  Light .
B :  Ye yes .
B :  Right . Neutral hydrogen Gunn-Petersen absorption .
B :  I think all of that's a spectral
B :  feature .
A :  Really ? It's a process , isn't it ?
B :  It's basically a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen t it's a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen trough though .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Which , if you just said that it's Gunn-Petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption , you'd mark the whole thing . If it was hydrogen align you would , so you should mark if it was or H_ beta absorption . It's a marks the kind of spectral feature , doesn't it ?
A :  Well
A :  Isn't that a process ?
A :  It's a process , isn't it ?
C :  Mm .
B :  But so is H_ beta absorp uh emission as a process from H_ beta . But it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen .
B :  I guess what I'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there . And the fact that Gunn-Peterson comes between it
B :  is just a pain .
A :  Well it I wouldn't
C :  Mm .
A :  have any of it , I think . I think all of that is um just that is process .
A :  Isn't it ?
C :  I think I might agree with you .
B :  Mm .
C :  'Cause this definitely shouldn't be marked .
C :  Because that is a process , not a
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And if that shouldn't be marked , then that shouldn't be marked .
B :  Okay . Let's just cross everything out .
C :  Right .
C : 
B :  Blue-shifted absorption .
C : 
B :  I think it's a modifier of the thing , and so it probably should be there .
C :  Oh okay . Mm .
B :  As in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count , so I think blue-shifted should . Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  that's talking about the line , isn't it ?
B :  So that should be in .
C :  Hmm yes . Okay .
A :  You think ?
B :  Yeah . That's talking about uh
B :  strength rather than
A :  Um
B :  It's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property , it's just the strength of the lines .
A :  You don't think that it
A :  Actually is abundance really in a way .
A :  I'm not sure . But
B :  I guess perhaps it is .
A :  I'm not sure . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I'm not sure either . But um
B :  Um let's make a decision .
C :  .
B :  I guess it could be abundance .
C :  B oh yeah , either that if that shouldn't be in , neither should either of those .
B :  Yes , that's true . I think you probably should then , 'cause we will put in our align strength . Uh if it's a F_ i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  And I think that's what it's referring to , even though it's not
A :  Uh i
B :  It's not saying
A :  Well , but it
B :  two .
A :  Isn't this an elemental um abundance
A :  that you estimate actually using a number of lines ? Is it it isn't just one discrete
A :  line in the spectrum , is it ? B
C :  A feature ?
A :  I'm not sure .
B :  Its lines .
C :  What do you mean ?
A :  Well if you t
B :  It's an abundance i it's an element I guess , but it's
A :  Two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of
C :  Is it
A :  Lines in the spectrum , and you'll uh estimate
A :  On the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines .
C :  Uh
B :  But it's a strength rather than abundance . I think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the F_E_ two lines , rather than
C :  We've marked thing have we marked things like
C :  Yeah , I don't know if we've marked things like silicone one
C :  throughout .
B :  In general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line , but I guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line . And I maybe it's not clear enough to mark .
A :  They haven't been if it's yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Let's not mark it then .
C :  Yeah . If we don't mark it though , we definitely shouldn't mark these two , should we ?
B :  Well line , narrow line . If it says it F_E_ two line strength then we would mark it , 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element .
C :  Do you agree with that ?
A :  I think so , yeah .
C :  If that's true then their leaving out the word line I don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked . But
B :  The word line should be in there . Or
A :  Oh well , what's new .
C :  But I mean , we know what they mean . Like
B :  Yeah , I think they mean l
B :  I think they mean the line strength rather than the F_E_ two abundance . I think that's what they probably mean . But it's just not very clear .
A :  Okay . Well , then have it in . Yeah , yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah , let's leave it in .
C :  Next .
C :  Uh
B :  B_S_ , bloated star . That's a
C :  Oh , is that what that means ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um take out line .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And that's just the wrong
C :  Seyfert two . Oh , yep .
B :  that's just the wrong colour , as is that .
C :  You're right .
B :  I think you were right there .
C :  Radio loud counts , yeah .
B :  Yep , you're right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And you're right there as well . That's a physical process .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  That counts .
B :  Yes , that was one I wasn't sure about , 'cause infrared . And if it was mid-infrar uh if it was , you'd put it in .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  That's just the wrong na that's just this should be a source name .
C :  Yeah , the and this shouldn't be , should it ?
B :  I don't know w
C :  M m does those count as modifiers active , we definitely include active .
B :  Yes . I guess the problem is due to what does that m mean . I presumed it
C :  So
C :  It's a k kind of elliptical , is it ?
A :  What does that mean ?
C :  A E_ two is a kind of elliptical . What I don't know what the J_ means .
A :  Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Is it ? Okay , right . 'Cause that's one I just didn't know what it
B :  Uh I thought it was a catalogue .
B :  Mm .
B :  H_ alpha I think should be marked , yeah .
C :  Those can does that not mean a a broad band detection ?
C :  And does that count ?
A :  Sorry , what's the I can't see .
C :  Uh H_ alpha detection .
B :  Yeah , you're still detecting a line , even if you're detecting it from broad-band filters .
C :  But don't we say we don't do that ?
B :  Um
C :  Ah . I'm right , look . Don't include modifiers of regions or systems , E_G_
B :  Broad-band
B :  Broad line region , you are right .
C :  region , systems . That's why I wasn't doing it .
B :  And now align nebulae . Okay , we'll just go back and change those . You're right .
A :  Right .
C :  G ah , look at that .
B :  Okay , where was it ? Started here . Um
B :  Why did it so we mark
B :  Um we have got nebulae marked here .
C :  Yeah , but b uh modifiers of regions or systems is the
B :  Oh . Yeah , okay , modifiers with them , which is give a yell if you see one .
C :  Yeah , we could always change this if we think we're right , rather than going back through and
B :  So damped Lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there .
C :  Based on this , but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things . What's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point ?
B :  But then I'm i I p I probably use that rule so half the time , and just forgotten to use at other times .
D :  Um so uh just about changing rules , I mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements that you arrive on today , that they're consistent with what you did before . Right , so uh I mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you disagreed . But if you sorta like change a rule now on the fly , then that might be then that might b uh create inconsistencies with the
B :  Mm .
C :  Right .
C :  Right . Right . Yep
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  'Cause you might have followed that rule . Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , I I'm sure I've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten . So let's take that out . Um
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
C :  Um
B :  Lyman alpha forest here .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But lyman alpha forest should be in here , because it's not talking about uh m it's not modified .
C :  Yeah , that's fine .
C :  Damped Lyman alpha systems .
B :  Damped Lyman alpha data .
C :  Ah , we're back to damped Lyman alpha data .
B :  Data I think we should keep in .
C :  Okay .
B :  Because it's would be the same as feature .
C :  I
B :  Or spec spectrum . I think data's the same as spectrum , 'cause the data is a spec m
C :  I do I still don't think that goes in . But
C :  Yeah . I still don't like it . But
B :  Final view , Bob ?
C :  I don't have passionate feelings .
A :  I wouldn't I think now probably .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm let's take that out .
B :  And this one comes out as well .
C :  Yep .
B :  Okay , so we want nothing .
C :  Yeah , just cross those out .
B :  There .
B :  Didn't it ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Oops .
B :  We're there . Right .
C :  Excellent . So what were we looking at this page for anyway ? It was for something else , H_ alpha detection .
B :  H_ alpha detection .
C :  Uh
C :  Broad band detections is in don't include .
B :  But I wouldn't is H_ alpha broad-brand ? It's a line .
A :  Well H_ L_ was a line there really , isn't it . So
B :  Whether you detect it
C :  Oh , so it would be a narrow band detection , a narrow band imaging detection . Alright , good .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think so .
B :  H_ alpha emitters are not
B :  a distinct class of source , I don't think .
C :  No , they aren't .
B :  Line .
D :  Just out of curiosity , this narrow and broad band , that that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have ? Like t on the type of filter or is it oh , okay . Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah , exactly that . Yeah , exactly that .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature , even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a spectral feat feature .
B :  If you're picking out a line . What however you pick it out .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yep .
B :  Line on its own .
B :  I think there's gonna be a lot of those , which makes life simpler .
C :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Right .
C :  Uh , this is another systems thing .
B :  Yep .
B :  Absorption profiles . I think that I think the whole thing should actually be marked .
B :  Even this complex . How far should we go ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No .
B :  Comple just absorption , per .
C :  . Um
C :  Yeah , absorption profiles I'll go for . Why not .
B :  Um
B :  Lyman alpha forest line blanketing or Lyman alpha forest line ?
C :  Yeah , take out the blanketing .
C :  Has this
C :  Ah , right .
B :  Is it a system ?
C :  Yep .
B :  V_L_B_A_ is an instrument . Oh , is it ?
C :  Yeah , V_L_B_I_ is uh a net uh it's it's a V_L_B_I_ is it's a technique . It's not a yeah .
B :  Is a network . But is it ?
A :  Technique . Yeah . The network is an instrument though , isn't it .
B :  Yes .
B :  V_
C :  What's it's called something else , isn't it ? The V_O_
A :  It
B :  V_L_ b very long baseline array . V_L_B_A_ . If it had an A_ on the end , it would be the ne instrument .
A :  It's E_V_N_ , isn't it ?
C :  Yeah , it's called a V_L_B_A_ .
C :  This is
A :  Well it
C :  V_L_B_I_ network image . So do they mean the V_L_B_A_ .
A :  Isn't all of
A :  This is an instrument if you have it all , isn't it ?
C :  European V_L_B_I_ net . Is it in it it's an intstru group instrument , not a research group .
A :  I think so .
B :  Yes , 'cause it ta it takes an image . So Oh , but then a m research group could take an image . Okay , let's oh , how much of modifiers are we putting in ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But um
C :  It's only supposed to be proper names . But I don't
A :  Which it is , uh I think .
C :  Yeah , is that so this whole thing is an instrument , you say .
B :  From one point six or from European ?
A :  That's what I think .
C :  Oh .
A :  Oh , I think it's uh um s s s starting with um Eu European I think .
B :  Or just um V_L_B_A_
B :  He's using capitals . But s
C :  Oh , I see , I see . Yeah .
C :  So is this like it's a subset of the V_L_B_A_ ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh yes .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  Just in Europe .
C :  Right .
A :  But it's actually Merlin and all the i um international logs in Europe , all
A :  hooked up into one instrument basically . Yeah .
C :  Cool .
B :  Okay .
C :  Right .
C :  Oh .
B :  .
C :  That is a source name , you're right .
B :  That's just broad-band , isn't it ? Broad line emission .
C :  Yeah , that's just
B :  So that shouldn't be marked .
B :  Radio-loud objects . It's not ve it's not a m mod It's not an original system . M
C :  Mm-hmm . We say something about objects , and I think it's that we don't use it .
B :  Anything ending in object we don't include , yep .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So none of those .
B :  Yep .
B :  Now we've both marked line ratios here .
C :  Yeah , but we shouldn't have done .
B :  And that's the same .
C :  So that's it , yeah .
B :  Continuum .
C :  Yeah , that's fair enough . It's certainly not a source name .
B :  And there it's different , because you're talking about the ionizing continuum , which is a pre
C :  Yeah , that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons , that's not the continuum you're looking at .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think you can point to line pairs .
C :  Sure you can , yep .
B :  And that shouldn't be in there .
C :  Mm nope .
C :  Neither should that .
B :  Yep . Scribble away .
C :  Excellent .
B :  You're right there . That's all one big spectral feature .
B :  And nebula shouldn't be marked .
C :  Have we agreed on that ?
B :  What do we do back here ?
C :  We only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula , but I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula . Yeah .
B :  What did we do back here ? We did mark nebula , yes .
B :  It was things that weren't distinct , like yeah .
C :  Yeah , but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula . I think is why I wasn't doing it .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm , yeah , it's a difficult one . But if we're gonna stick to it , let's stick to it .
C :  Yeah . If we're going to have them , let's have them .
B :  The ? The .
C :  What's different ?
C :  Oh , yeah . Um , don't mind .
B :  And I think we need the . I think we would put stop putting the in , we could get confused . And you're right there .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C : 
C :  You're right .
C :  There .
C :  Source type .
B :  Oh , yeah .
C :  Line blanketing .
B :  Line blanketing , you think y
C :  Sh I no , I don't think I did I ?
B :  We had line blanketing just now and we included it . I think we sh um .
C :  So that yeah . Did we ?
A :  Did you ? I thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included .
C :  Ah
C :  Um
B :  Where was it ?
C :  We did just have it , don't know . It wasn't that far back , was it ? No , it wasn't that far back .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Don't think n Lyman f forest line blanket , we took blanketing out .
C :  Line yeah , we took blanketing out , so I don't think that should be in .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And that's all the same .
C :  Is that it ? Yeah .
C :  Uh that's a source nine .
B :  Yes . Yes , it is .
C :  Isn't it ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Red and blue components .
B :  I think you're right there as well .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . I think I'm right .
B :  .
A :  Really ?
B :  Yeah , I think i in the same way that you can point to
C :  Oh , yeah .
B :  the soft X_ rays or or the hard X_ rays , you can point to the red and the
A :  Well I would argue about that,you see , because I think that I mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum , don't you ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an X_ ray thing . You kn you know if there's one there or not , you could say that's that . So
A :  Yeah . But , have a component though as such .
C :  You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd
C :  w oh yeah . I see what
B :  But we're talking about the c the continuum though . If you have a galaxy spectrum though , you can say there's the blue component , there's the red component to the spectrum . Oh , I see what you mean , i like it comes from adding two different things together .
A :  Yeah , g um c
A :  Yeah , that's that's what I'm thinking , that
C :  Mm .
B :  I can see that , yeah .
A : 
A :  It's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum , not just actually looking at the spectrum . Yeah , you think ?
C :  But results from spectral .
B :  Yes .
C :  Give that for red and blue components , but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component . Because a soft excess is a uh I mean that's an X_ ray thing . Like a break , you say oh look , there's
B :  But if it said red or blue excess rather than red or blue component , I guess the problem with
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though .
C :  Mm . Yeah . Yeah , I'd take out red and blue .
B :  Mm-hmm , okay .
B :  Let's
C :  Which means maybe we should take out soft . But it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess , it's a soft
A :  Well uh
A :  The excesses , yeah . But um the component isn't .
C :  Yeah . It's just a t
B :  If you modelled it with two parts , one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum Hubble in Hubble deep field south .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That's probably true , yeah .
C :  Um Hubble and Hubble deep sent to us .
B :  I didn't include it . Although it does apply to the telescope . But mm .
A :  I think I would . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Let's keep it in .
C :  So should w did we have a soft component earlier ? So we sh should kill it .
A :  Yes . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Anyone remember when ?
C :  No .
A :  I think actually pretty early on I'd have thought
B :  Let's start at the beginning .
C :  Yeah .
C :  There it is .
B :  Oh . Excellent .
B :  Um
C :  Right .
B :  Hubble . .
C :  Alright .
B :  No wait , the top one I think you should include .
B :  Possibly with flux as well though .
C :  Mm d yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah , that's fine , I'm happy with all that .
B :  And then yes , the whole thing .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
B :  Well , I said radio galaxies . Now what did we p we say about acronyms where part of it was useful ? Um
C :  Yeah , that counts .
C : 
C :  Do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies ? 'Cause I think
C :  they are discussed as a separate source type , aren't they ?
A :  Where are they ?
B :  Um
C :  radio galaxies ?
A :  Uh only just
A :  Interesting because on the hour it yeah .
C :  It hides that , yeah . Yeah , you're right .
B :  But I don't think we should mark high red-shift in that . They are just red-shi but yes . Wh what did we say about acronyms where
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
A :  No it is yeah .
C :  Where part of it's useful . I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing , aren't you ? Yeah , so you're right .
B :  Yes , I think you are .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um
B :  Seyfert one point eight and one point nine galaxies
C :  It's a sub-classification of Seyfert's . would make a s study Seyfert one point eights . Oh do they ?
B :  You wouldn't say we're talking about yes .
A :  Well people do though , don't they ? I mean it's pretty s stupid , but they do .
B :  I think they probably are .
C :  You're right , yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Inseparate . And it's just the and that annoys .
C :  Yeah , that's fine .
B :  Mission line feature we're gonna include .
C :  Uh yep .
C :  Yeah , galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count .
B :  Galaxy when it's a process . Yes .
C :  And yes , that counts .
B :  Ah , now this is one
B :  where it should be this one , but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined ? Has it just plotted the top colour ?
C :  But in
D :  Oh , was it actually possible to doubly underline things ? Um
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't know wh which one it would display then .
B :  Okay , because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that , but with also broad line
C :  Right , but I'm on the
C :  Yeah .
B :  I can't write .
D :  I I actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations ? Right , okay .
B :  We changed it so that you could . Yeah , because quite often uh an object class is defined by a spectral feature .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Like broad line radio galaxies .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Broader lines , I think .
C :  Yeah , I don't think that should go in .
C :  Don't mind . Oh , up here .
B :  List the wrong wrong colour for a few things . Oh , it's all here . Hyper-luminous galaxy .
A :  If you're having ultra-loom this early on , then I think you have to have here .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  This is just a colour issue .
C :  Mm .
C :  Is it ? Or is it oh , right . And Q_S_O_ is not yeah , you're right .
B :  Yeah , they should all be and that one .
C :  Yep .
B :  I_S_M_ . It's diffuse .
B :  So it probably shouldn't be in there .
C :  The I_S_M_ isn't a source type . Is it ?
B :  Oh . No .
A :  I don't think so .
B :  What we doing about nebula again ? I've forgotten .
C :  We're now including nebula , aren't we ?
B :  Okay . Yeah .
C :  Mm what have we done , features .
B :  Features .
C :  Mm yep . .
B :  Flat spectrum radio quasars .
B :  Strong drop in the continuum . I think you're right there .
C :  Okay .
C :  Nope .
B :  I think you're right again . That's just the place .
C :  Yep .
C :  We aren't doing emission line objects .
B :  Um we're not doing emission line when it's a modifier of objects , are we ?
C :  Oh no , we aren't doing that either , you're right .
B :  The question is are emission line objects a separate class of source ? I think they are .
C :  Mm no . They aren't , are they ?
A :  But t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , you're right .
A :  So there goes
C :  Yeah , anything to do with objects . So nothing .
B :  And Seyfert galaxies w should be one , you're right there .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  I got three seventy .
D :  That's pretty good , that's nearly a third .
A :  And you s speed it up as well I think . So
