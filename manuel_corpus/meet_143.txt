B :  until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .

A :  Okay . Very good .
A :  So , we have
D :  That's on the rub rubber part .
B :  Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .
A :  So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . So , that's it . That's prototype . Now , the finance .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah ?
A :  We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . So , I'm gonna look . We have Sorry ?
D :  Alright .
D :  Do we Do we change the
D :  Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
A :  Finance is um Yeah it's
A :  No , first uh
A :  Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Sorry .
D :  Okay . That's uh um That can be none .
D :  Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up .
D :  Uh-oh . Okay .
D :  Um , yeah . Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .
D :  Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document
A :  Criteria .
D :  You So we open up that blank here . Um
D :  Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can
D :  get a number in here .
D :  Hmm .
A :  No , it's okay .
D :  Well , uh we can't do that .
C :  I'll get it .
A :  Oh , it's okay .
D :  Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
D :  Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .
D :  And in the end , we will c uh count an average
D :  of all rating . The first uh on each item .
A :  What do you think ?
D :  Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ .
D :  So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . Hmm .
C :  I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
C :  What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an
C :  seven . Si six six . Sorry , six .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . And you true or false . And true is one .
C :  Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry .
D :  So , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Two .
A :  You ?
B :  Three .
A :  Me too . So it's a three .
D :  'Kay . Um , well
D :  It's a one . The first item .
D :  So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
B :  Mm
D :  Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .
A :  So it's a
D :  That's uh a six .
C :  Five .
B :  Mm , four .
A :  Yes , it's for the
A :  younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
B :  Yeah , but it's it's
A :  So I think it's four .
B :  Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So I mean , the colours are for young people , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  No .
A :  Yes . So , I think it's four .
B :  older
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours .
B :  Yeah . Maybe .
A :  Okay . Give it a four . Yep .
C :  Four .
D :  Four . Uh , okay . Mm .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics .
D :  That's uh the motto of our company .
D :  Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?
D :  I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .
C :  Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh
C :  techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .
B :  Yes . Two .
D :  Two .
A :  Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new .
A :  It must be a fashion .
A :  But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion
C :  It it will be fashion .
A :  we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .
D :  Uh Okay .
B :  Then make it th three .
D :  Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ?
A :  No . Oh . I use my feet though .
C :  'Kay . Three is okay .
C :  Oh , we'll wait outside .
D :  A three .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah okay .
D :  The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .
C :  I give it a one .
B :  .
B :  Yes , a one . I like it .
A :  Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half .
D :  We have to do our uh Two or three ? Two . Okay .
C :  Say two . Two .
A :  Okay , two .
D :  So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep .
D :  Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average .
D :  So , um that's why it's a negative in it .
D :  Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .
D :  But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .
C :  One .
A :  You ?
B :  One .
A :  Me too . One .
D :  One .
D :  Um , but where where is the ?
A :  Next , six .
A :  It does not get lost easily .
D :  So
D :  Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
C :  Uh Just a small thing .
B :  Yes .
A :  No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so .
B :  Yeah , but uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah . Yellow . Looks like a pistol . Uh
A :  Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So
C :  It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
A :  No .
A :  It won't get lost . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh
D :  It won't .
A :  A one ?
C :  Yeah , o one .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , a one . Next .
D :  One .
D :  Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
A :  Yeah me
C :  Yeah . Me too .
A :  That was our target . Two .
C :  Two . Yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . Right .
A :  There's a fancy look-and-feel .
D :  Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ?
D :  I would say yes . So um
D :  Well , let's also give this a two . T
C :  I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yes , a one .
A :  I say a two .
A :  It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . So I think s two is better .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Okay . Two . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .
C :  Two is okay . .
A :  No , it's new . Innovation .
D :  If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
D :  We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . I We'll go for a three .
C :  Oh .
C :  I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh
A :  .
D :  Yes .
C :  But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm , three .
A :  Me too . Three .
D :  A three .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes .
A :  Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
D :  By nine .
C :  Two .
D :  Yeah . Um , uh okay .
D :  Two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Come on .
A :  Uh , nah .
A :  Okay .
D :  So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
B :  Yes .
A :  So , it's good .
D :  So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Yeah , I think .
D :  Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .
D :  And I closed your slide-show .
A :  Okay . Back to my uh
D :  Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .
A :  Yep .
A :  Next please . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ?
D :  Next .
D :  Finance .
A :  Um , so if uh I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Cheapest there is .
A :  Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .
C :  Expensive .
A :  Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print .
A :  We have that one .
C :  Well , it's the most advanced .
A :  We have the simple , regular and advanced .
C :  Advanced .
A :  We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved .
A : 
A :  So
A :  Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . we have half rubber , half plastic .
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  No titanium . Special colour .
A :  Yes , yellow .
C :  Uh , yellow .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Interface , push-button .
A :  Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_
A :  We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
C :  One .
D :  One .
A :  And it's not really a s
C :  Joystick uh thing .
D :  .
A :  Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So , then uh then then then then then then
A :  Then
C :  We're not gonna make it .
A :  Uh , no . It's too expensive .
C :  Yeah . Wh
A :  So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve .
C :  What what are the costs ?
C :  Fifteen .
A :  We have rubber , special colour .
D :  .
D :  We would have uh n
C :  A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
A :  Oh , no , we No , it's uh
A :  Sorry ?
C :  Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
D :  For a remote control . I've For a remote control , I think it is .
C :  What ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .
D :  For up down left right .
A :  Um , then we uh lose
A :  two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much .
A :  Exactly the special colours .
C :  And what if we use only one sort of um
A :  So
C :  Um just only plastic or only rubber ?
A :  That's one Euro .
C :  One Euro discount .
A :  So , I don't think that's good .
A :  Mm
A :  I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
A :  If
C :  If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
A :  Yes .
A :  Then it's
A :  only thirteen Euros .
C :  And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
A :  So uh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then you have Or you have to cut this off .
C :  Uh uh-uh .
A :  Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look .
C :  No .
A :  We
C :  And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it .
A :  Yellow rubber .
A :  Yeah , normal .
C :  Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
A :  Uh
C :  And it's twelve Euros , I think .
A :  One minute , please . Uh Is it maximum . Um
A :  Yeah , it's normal colour .
A :  But if you lose the
A :  joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
C :  No . Uh , no , no , no . Uh
A :  Or it's then a regular ?
C :  Oh , wait wait wait .
D :  The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
C :  If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , regular chip . But
A :  Is it a good design ?
C :  Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have
C :  the L_C_D_ .
D :  If uh
C :  So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date .
D :  If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , yes .
D :  And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it's okay .
C :  Huh . No knew that .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .
C :  Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .
A :  Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit .
A :  And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,
B :  Okay . All the same uh
A :  you have to pay
A :  point two Euros .
C :  So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh
A :  Yes .
C :  for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?
B :  Mm , yeah .
B :  Recognisable . Like what Yeah .
C :  Recognisable , yeah .
A :  Yes .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So
C :  Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So Well
A :  Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?
C :  Oh , well that's clear .
A :  So
A :  And
A :  Where's ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  So , now it's
C :  And the joystick away .
C :  And its buttons .
A :  Yeah . It is . But then it will be
A :  just that ones .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now it's
D :  still , he waited at the
A :  Very good . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well
D :  No .
A :  What do you think of it ? Uh
C :  About the
A :  About the project .
D :  Project .
C :  process . Went good .
C :  Uh
C :  I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um
C :  Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . So yeah that was clear .
C :  Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it .
C :  And uh no , uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult .
C :  But , nah . New ideas found .
C :  Nope .
A :  Okay . And you .
B :  Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh
B :  Yeah , it uh
B :  It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um
D :  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse .
D :  Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
D :  And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .
D :  To tell their opinion .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed .
C :  No .
B :  No .
C :  Yep .
A :  So , I think we're ready . Good price . Evaluation ready .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Ready .
C :  Beer .
A :  That's it .
C :  Yeah ? Okay then .
D :  Okay .
B :  .
