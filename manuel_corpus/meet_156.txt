B :  Okay . So as you guys know f , ISSCO is too small . Well , the building is too small for our group . So we're moving to a new building . Uh it's gonna be the building across the street . And we're actually moving in three weeks . But the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer , the fax machine , all the big equipment . And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment . And they want to know where we're gonna do all this by November second .
B :  So that means basically next Tuesday . And since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today . What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people , which is okay , 'cause there's only fifteen of us . And all the rooms have windows luckily , so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't . Um there's two views , either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes . There's two three people rooms , five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building , so you actually get windows on two walls , and two one person rooms .
B :  That's pretty much what the building looks like . Um and then you have the number of people per room . The courtyard , because we're on the sixth floor , you can't actually go out to it , but it just means that the windows look out onto open space . Um you can see the bathrooms , the elevators are sort of further down the hall . The purple bar at the bottom , sort of on the right is the mail-boxes . All of the windows open , you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building . And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like I said the photocopier , which is really big , the fax machine , which is not so big , and the printer , which is relatively big .
B :  Each office has a white board , a bulletin board and a coat rack . No cupboards like we have in the current offices , and each person gets their own chair , their own corner desk , so like the n the ones that we have now , um a small filing cabinet with three drawers , and by small I mean they're about that tall , and one sort of hanging shelf . So we don't get the bookcases like we have now , but just one shelf that's attached to the wall .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And the people that we have to place , uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on . And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people . Whether we want to do it by rank , or by project , or
B :  I don't know , put all the P_H_D_ students together , all the professors together , that sort of thing . So the idea is that we come up with a plan . there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week . And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second . So we have to come up with a plan , possibly , if we have time , a presentation , a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best . Okay ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Alright .
B :  So , anyone have any ideas or
B :  I guess
A :  Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall .
B :  Yeah . Um I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building . So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall , so they can't be removed , then it should be okay to leave them in the hall .
A :  Um .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  We can put it . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  It's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documents or n whatever .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm yeah .
D :  So we only get one printer for fifteen people ?
B :  Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers . I think Susan has a personal printer , Gisella has one maybe .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , and that's it .
B :  I can't remember who else . Yeah . But no-one else gets their own printer . In terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
B :  So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics , and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals , as to exactly where to put people .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Does that work ? Oh , and on the map the little half-circular , well , quater circles are doors , which I'm assuming you've figured out , but just in case . And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it , the the three person room on the right . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm okay .
C :  'Kay sure . Yeah
D :  The three person room ?
A :  rooms , yeah . And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah .
B :  Yes , yeah . A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room .
C :  That's a good idea .
B :  So we should leave a space for that . And we can , because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us . And I don't know if you've noticed , but two of us are only here half the time . So Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva . So
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  sort of keep that in mind , I guess , when
A :  Mm .
B :  you are doing the actual planning .
D :  Mm .
A :  The first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh . I mean , it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then
B :  Yeah .
A :  for the other .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
B :  But Gisella's really the only administrator . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other , because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite , I mean , Gile Gisella's work is quite noisy , because it's secretary so , yeah , lot of phone call and stuff like that so Yeah , so you won't share an office with Gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is working , which is another condition .
C :  Ad administrator .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And she's always moving around .
B :  No .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them .
A :  Yeah mm .
A :  So I don't know , maybe we can decide that Gisella is having one of the one person room .
D :  Yeah , I w I would suggest that too . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that would be
C :  maybe convenient .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . Either that or maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or
C :  With someone
C :  Yeah , and with someone who is who is fifty pro percent .
B :  Like with the the photocopier , or Maybe not the photocopier , but the printer .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But at least the thing we know that Gisella is gonna be alone .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay , mm-hmm .
A :  Or with equipment , but
B :  And not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker .
A :  humanly alone . Yeah .
D :  Okay , so th that's a one person room , but we don't know how how big they are . Or it's hard to tell . I mean , Gisella has this funny uh typing uh thing . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this
C :  Typing machine .
D :  Computer , fax .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So probably sh she should get the fax , right ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , that makes sense to put the fax in there .
C :  Yes , yeah .
B :  Uh .
B :  So .
A :  And then I think the main discussion we should have is
A :  um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title
B :  Yeah .
C :  Or uh yeah , professor assistent or uh
A :  or Yeah . Or Yeah . Couple of professor and assistant or
C :  Or uh yeah
A :  That's more a conceptual question than a practical question .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , the third option is just completely mix everyone up , which some people say is better sort of for a group environment , so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project . Right . So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project , you find out about that project , but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Mm mm .
C :  But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room , because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe . I don't know if it's uh
C :  for other people who is not working on the same project . Yeah , that's true . That's that's true . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but we will have this reading room , which can be
D :  'Kay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there . Can reserve it for meetings .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it's not a question of reserving it , because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting , but if it's empty , then sure you can use it for a meeting . There's nothing wrong with that . But I think if someone's already reading in there , it's not fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting 'cause
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , for a real meeting .
C :  You can u mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Well , the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short meeting and discuss some issues . Or maybe we shouldn't call it reading room , but
C :  Meeting about the project .
A :  No .
B :  But if you're having a short meeting you don't really
B :  make an appointment for it . You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  'Cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal
A :  Mm yeah . The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not , because
B :  Yeah .
A :  Marianne and I interact a lot with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that . So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and So it's maybe
C :  Yeah . Hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . And the other Marianne too . So there's three of you .
A :  Yeah , so maybe it's not really nice to have to share an office with somebody like us , having a lot of social life and
C :  People coming and going .
B :  Well , but then you either share offices with each other , which doesn't really solve the problem , because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , we don't .
B :  So you're still going to have
A :  Yeah .
B :  Like unless you get individual offices , I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . I dunno .
B :  'Cause even if each of you share with a professor , then it's the same thing for the professor .
A :  Yeah mm mm .
C :  Yep , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But it is something to keep in mind .
B :  Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap , and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there . Some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that and make plans with that because
C :  Mm .
B :  No .
B :  No , but you sort of see people's patterns . I mean ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  even if it's not always like that , I mean if it's like that , you know , eighty per cent of the time , then
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But you're right , we can't make assumptions too much .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and
A :  I don't know .
B :  I think
B :  Well , it's up to us how we do it . I can see benefits of both .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it certainly is .
B :  But
A :  One point I can say by experience , it's really hard to share an office with three people , because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office .
B :  Yeah . Plus the computers .
A :  Plus the computers . So
C :  Plus the com Mm-hmm .
B :  And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office .
A :  Yeah . So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary
A :  a room with three people . A working room .
C :  Yeah , but if there are people coming in , I mean , we have these people working for uh two months , who comes in the summertime or something . I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too . So uh
B :  Yeah , that's a good point , because if we take the three person room out as a reading room ,
C :  It's quite big
B :  then everyone has an office , right ? 'Cause it's maximum eighteen .
B :  So take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen , and you're right , if we do have a stagieur , whoever , who comes in , then we have nowhere Well , we can put them in the reading room , but that kind of defeats the purpose .
A :  Oh yeah . Mm . Oh yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  So the other solution is to say , okay we use a three person room , but only with two person each time . And leave a spare space for or
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's a good idea , yeah .
C :  For soemthing , yeah , mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But avoiding
A :  having three person full-time in a same room could be a good idea , I think .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's yeah , certainly is .
B :  Or again find people who don't work the same hours .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It doesn't completely solve the problem , but
A :  Mm .
A :  So for the reading room we will have a two person room .
D :  Yeah . Everybody agrees on that , yep ?
B :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  Maybe that would be good .
A :  Okay .
B :  A one person'll be too small anyways .
A :  Yeah .
D :  How about how about this room ?
A :  Which one ?
B :  The one on the bottom ?
D :  Yeah , at the bottom in the middle . With a view to the mountains , yeah . It has three windows so I think it's uh Two ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  With the mountain ?
B :  Two . Well , which W There's three two person rooms .
D :  O one two
D :  The the middle one .
B :  That has two windows .
A :  Yeah , it's
B :  Which is fine . And still a big room .
D :  Two .
A :  Big black stripe is the windows , not the thin one between the big But what about the d the other one which has only one windows , but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet .
D :  Oh , the big Oh . Ah okay .
B :  Yeah , so I should have explained that .
B :  Yeah , but then you get don't get a lot of light
B :  for reading .
A :  We have electricity so
B :  Really ?
A :  I hope .
A :  No it's a question I mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and
B :  That's
C :  On the sixth floor , I don't know .
A :  Yeah , we are on the sixth floor .
B :  I dunno , I like the idea of looking out over
C :  Yeah , if you are if you are reading .
A :  Yeah . And stop reading .
D :  Me too .
B :  lots of space .
A :  So it's a relaxing room .
B :  Well , I mean that that's the whole point , right . It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space .
A :  Yeah , yeah , no okay .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Do so Yeah .
A :  Mm yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah , and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there . You know , quick meetings always get longer .
A :  Mm . So what about one of the room in the corner ? So you have three windows . It's even better .
B :  Yeah , we could do that .
C :  Why not ? Yeah .
A :  But you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that .
B :  Yeah .
A :  If you intend the reading room being more a library or
B :  We have some shelves , like cabinet type shelves for the reading room . But it's not really intended to be a library . I mean , we have
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  A library down downstairs . Mm .
B :  an I_T_ library . Um but
A :  Mm .
B :  the other idea is to take 'Cause right now we all have bookshelves . So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people , put them all into that room . So it becomes sort of
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Kind of , yeah , small library .
B :  a mini-library , but not like a library system library , just go and borrow your collegues' books .
A :  No no , no no . No no , sure but Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  So are we all agree about these two person rooms ?
A :  Which one ? Corner or not corner ?
D :  I don't know .
B :  I think the middle one .
C :  In the middle , yeah .
A :  The middle one . Okay .
B :  Yeah . It's also sort of m central to the layout , so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Okay .
B :  It's not that it makes that much of a difference , but
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Why not ?
B :  Uh .
A :  So we can exclude this one to make an office .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Actually what I can do is
A :  Or maybe write on the board , I don't know .
B :  Yeah . Um actually that's a good idea . J just put it up .
A :  So we have the map and
B :  Yeah .
B :  So .
B :  This really isn't to scale , but Oh well .
B :  Um .
B :  That's really not to scale . Um so we've got an office there .
A :  It's alright .
C :  Oh it's g good enough .
B :  And there's
B :  two and one
A :  Three , yeah .
B :  Is that all ?
A :  Yeah , yeah mm .
A :  So
B :  Okay so this is
B :  that . And this becomes the reading room , right ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Yes .
A :  Is that a mountain ? Okay .
A :  And that an old town ?
C :  And uh Gisella ?
A :  Yeah , should we decide also the administration stuff ? And
C :  We thought a one person room .
B :  Sure .
A :  So we exclude the n the thing we are quite sure , and then we discuss the
B :  Yeah .
D :  I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes . Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three
C :  Person room .
D :  person room .
A :  That's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration .
D :  Well , th
B :  But if Gisella works fifty percent and they work fifty percent
D :  They're fifty per cent , yeah .
A :  Yeah , that just imply you expect people to come when Gisella is not working , and that's not really fair if you
B :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , I mean it
A :  So we can put Gisella in the two people room
A :  which is near the mailbox .
A :  No .
D :  W yeah we could .
A :  I don't know .
D :  We could . I mean , I don't know how noisy she is . It's uh
A :  I it's just the question , you always have the phone ringing , even if the af even when she's not working .
B :  But
B :  Just
C :  Or f
B :  Does Gisella have her own printer ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , yes , she does .
A :  Yeah , but that's that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be n near the mail box and the printer and
B :  Well if you put her in in this room here , it's relatively close .
A :  and the photocopier and stuff like that .
A :  Yeah . Exc except the door is not really
D :  Convenient for her , yeah .
A :  convenient .
B :  True .
A :  No , but I think , if if the main , um how can I put that , the mm
A :  If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place , is the proximity of the mailbox , it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room .
D :  Okay . It's fine with me .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Otherwise we have a one people room and
B :  I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters , because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail , she actually brings it to your office . It's more the I_T_ administration that uses our mailboxes .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it's it's not the m
A :  Yeah . No but it's it's also it's also the place of the photocopier .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  And the place where we all pass kind of .
A :  Yeah .
B :  That's true .
C :  It should be some central place .
A :  Because if we put the photocopier near the mail box and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah unless you put it into an office , which is just an annoying , I think . 'Cause even if you put it into Gisella's office it's gonna be
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah oh no .
A :  Yeah , no , it's too
A :  And it's too big and
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , we should write this down . Do we agree that the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes ?
B :  So .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
B :  Mm .
A :  And then we can for the moment put Gisella in this corner room if you agree , I don't know .
D :  Yeah . What with
B :  At the beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But this option of putting Gisella near the photocopier .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean she is sharing an office right now and I Has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or
A :  I mean , she is not sharing an office . I mean sh we put some trainee in Gisella's office , because there is a spare room , and that's quite imp Yeah , that's quite uh I mean , that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office , if we need more staff , but
B :  Well , she's Go ahead .
B :  Stagieurs in there .
B :  And they are not really in a position to complain .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I wouldn't work in Gisella's office .
D :  Okay .
B :  I think it's just a question of work conditions , like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months , then you can put up with it , but if you're there , you know , for the full year
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  I it Yeah . So for example now if uh we reserve
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  For example , and there is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella , because she got lots of paper archives and files and stuff like that . So it's really , she needs
D :  Yeah that's true .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  She needs spaces . Okay .
A :  space .
C :  Yeah , yeah . But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room , we can put uh trainees
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , in there if they need to go .
C :  Further on if they are in the same room .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so Gisella at this southwest office ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  In the corner .
A :  Are you sure it's southwest ? I dunno if thi if this map is a
B :  South Well , southwest if that's north .
C :  South .
A :  Okay , the map is north oriented . Okay . No .
B :  Southwest for us . No tha Well , I'm assuming that's what you meant , right ? That
D :  Yeah , yeah , that that one , yeah .
A :  Okay . I don't know .
B :  But that's southeast anyways .
C :  Southeast , yeah . That's southeast .
D :  Oh right , yeah , that's southeast , yeah it's
A :  Anyways yeah , but
B :  This office right ? That's .
D :  Yeah , this office , yeah .
A :  Okay . You know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not No , sorry until but
B :  No , I I'm very bad at orienting where's north in Geneva , I always get it wrong . But I just assumed Nikos was talking about the orientation here .
D :  Uh yeah , I was just talking about uh here on the map .
A :  Okay .
A :  No , because sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine , sunrise and sunset is quite also a good um
B :  Oh , that's true .
B :  So wait , we face the old town we face the old town now , and we are facing
A :  something to take into account .
A :  Uh northeast .
C :  North .
B :  northeast .
A :  Sunrise .
B :  Okay . So .
B :  This is northeast .
A :  It's east , yeah , east . No , east .
A :  We we have sun in the morning only .
B :  Yeah .
C :  When do we have sun ?
A :  So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  This one .
C :  But s
A :  Let's say that .
D :  The three people room or
A :  It's it's the one you have of now , you both .
B :  It's the oven .
A :  More or less .
C :  Well , there is a quite a lot of sun .
A :  You get the sunset then . No ? And it's really warm and
C :  Y yes and no . It's , yeah , it's really warm , that's
D :  You get lots of sun during summer , yes .
A :  Do you Uh by the way , is it a six floor building or is there more
C :  Yeah yeah , that's true .
B :  Yeah , we're the top floor .
A :  Okay . So it's warm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now , we're just getting more space this way , because we couldn't move in the other building , 'cause it was occupied by the other departments .
A :  Mm . Okay .
C :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay , good , p so
A :  So how many rooms
C :  And next .
A :  and uh how many place do we have ?
C :  So we have reserved now two two person rooms .
B :  Actually , why don't I change it on here as well .
B :  So that's Gisella .
A :  Yeah , plus one spare place , but really the last place to be used .
D :  Plus spare , yeah .
B :  Plus fax .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And then this is the reading room .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oops .
B :  Um .
B :  So that leaves us with what ? Six , eight , fourteen places , which is
A :  We got two , three , four , six , nine
D :  We got
A :  Fourteen places ?
D :  For fourteen people ?
B :  For f Yeah . No for fourteen , 'cause Gisella's already got a room .
