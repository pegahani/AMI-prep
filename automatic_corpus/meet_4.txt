A :  Yeah it is
D :  Yeah
D :  So it's
C :  Yes
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Maybe it was the pen supposed to do the states
A :  But we say four of them that
A :  It's like basically
B :  Okay
B :  So
B :  My through it's uh
B :  But again
B :  Probably in one hand
B :  Um
B :  So well that is important for him to be here uh
C :  Okay
B :  He
B :  You do it didn't work together it did you
C :  Yeah we'll
C :  It's a lot of you too
D :  So
C :  To summarise our meeting but still i think uh it to be in very important as the
B :  Yes
C :  I was uh um
C :  I mean designer
C :  I think you've been proven that he's yeah
B :  Yes
C :  Um basically we are we
C :  We designed uh to ooh
C :  A items
B :  Um yes but
B :  We
C :  Can we have a phone uh and some um
B :  Yes you should from him
C :  It's really know what went design
B :  Um well
B :  Um
A :  Mm
B :  But he's not here we will just to we just have to continue
B :  Um so just for records i i will take uh not c. n.
A :  Okay
B :  And um
B :  Well
B :  First thing uh i was uh
B :  Uh
B :  I got an email from uh from us to prove again that we really should stay within the budget
B :  Off the uh
B :  Twelve euro and fifty cents
B :  So uh oh you said to me well
B :  Uhuh
B :  When you stay in school would wanna you don't stay in you have to redesign
B :  Or no
B :  No negotiation uh
B :  Possible in this matter
B :  So we have to consider that
B :  Um
B :  So
B :  Maybe an a
B :  You can have your
A :  Well with that know that evaluation do we have a design
B :  Okay it's it's a nice uh
D :  It
B :  Very good
B :  All it maybe then you can start now with
B :  Preventing your uh your designs
C :  Yeah
D :  Ah
C :  So i was taught by the
C :  The basic one that uh
C :  Fits in two
C :  Uh
C :  Eight euros actually
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Right seven eight euros
C :  And um at what it
C :  First
C :  For both to have a um a special shape but maybe the design i can i extend better than me
C :  But um seconds of board
C :  And you're you're supposed to suffer to brawls
A :  Okay
C :  Two's of t. v.
C :  Maybe the way but
C :  And uh it's kind of interesting shape because
C :  Um and consciously people want to see too so
C :  I went to see this that i know so it's not too far from um i will buy
D :  This was this
D :  Oh results
C :  So people i used to that kind of shape right
C :  Don't take get too much or the colour because
C :  Yeah
D :  Now we are supposed to use some more of a person like that
C :  But we don't
C :  Yeah
C :  So here would be basically the the uh uh
C :  The infrared uh
B :  Hi
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Right yeah
C :  Red and i it it it again
D :  And the d.
C :  The on off button in red
C :  Here would be the volume
A :  Yeah
C :  On the on the left
D :  Mm hmm hmm
C :  Okay to be easy to turn on and off
C :  And um so
C :  This is it a very cheap version so there are
C :  Maybe you can carry on uh much you
D :  Also
D :  So you have a
D :  Um browsing the cannot speculate so you can go up and down arrows
D :  Uhuh
D :  If you have where do you do all or something it and forward
C :  How can you change from v. c. r. to uh to you by the way
D :  Well maybe it's number on this thing at the the the more to do is the t. v. one
C :  Oh yeah
D :  Number to study do the standard do you wanna know about what that is so and then yeah i usually that was keys but you know that that is a very high one to ten digits
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Next uh two or four uh
D :  Having uh i'll give you an option for
D :  Ah
D :  Hiring more than one channel
D :  And the other one is for the teletext or something you want about two on that
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay sorry it's it's a very basic go right there's i mean
D :  Okay
D :  It's a very basic mean the thing which you can adjust
A :  Mm
D :  Which is also
D :  Other than the market
D :  Actually that's what to do that today you do and it cost us to but it is
A :  Hmm
D :  About a two euros
C :  Yes yes
B :  Except except for the for the special shape b. circuit board it has a quite uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Uh conventional layout of buttons
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  So this one more well and uh
A :  Can i say
D :  Yeah
D :  Sure
A :  That the volume control that's good
C :  On this
D :  But they're they're at the the magic one but that may be don't want to talk about that too
D :  Yeah but this is
D :  Yeah it did either but if you do this to use like uh
D :  It's like a big machine and the fruits that most of a weird thing to go to the future can tell
A :  So it does
D :  So that the uh
D :  Oh
D :  And then what you look
A :  It was
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah you can
D :  This is the model yeah
B :  I just
B :  We'll have to fall yes it really feels like like
B :  Like a mobile phone
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Just time
C :  Yes yeah
B :  I really was talked with
B :  So but but it can see your with your uh
D :  Uh so
D :  Rather than that
D :  The the the l.
D :  Um more
D :  A litter that's more than they use a lot of functionality
D :  Well uh in this day
D :  So i read have a then you see the the only sixties but don't worry there oh my
D :  They're doing they're double squeaky that it easier
A :  Right
B :  Mm
D :  And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to
D :  Uh use this
D :  And uh
D :  You have a um
D :  So this is a standard uh you're there is an infrared
D :  I and then you have a power but then
D :  Shouldn't what what you mean what you have
B :  Uh-huh
D :  And then other than that you have uh uh
D :  Channel up and down and they'll still balls or it's
D :  It's mould or
D :  Yeah so paul was on top
D :  And uh
D :  Then there
D :  You can uh uh you have a l. c. d. display
D :  If he uh and uh
D :  You did to the functional thing which can change like is that a switch
D :  Which could be
D :  J. in the function and say you you go to you
B :  From a d. v. d. player to television
D :  Yeah i did you can change it so
C :  Exactly yeah
C :  Or do and to you and demand
D :  Instead of having many switches it
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah so and and then you get feedback fide l. c. d.
D :  Yeah c. d. can display what do that on that
D :  And uh well you can have a integrate the microphone or here
C :  This is a i want that and
D :  Although that and they're here so
D :  Of each can uh uh basically you want or the speech recognition and and uh that i don't know what are informative can be the displayed here to be on the
D :  Um
D :  On your on your display
C :  And yeah
D :  And here is that
D :  More l. a. t. v. did like blinking one
D :  Or we can see like there are you running out of the battery and reuse it can be useful for the locating yeah that was talking earlier
D :  And that but then you have a cover with c. d. c. d. c. d. you don't need much other than this
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh then you need you can use it
D :  And the disease that is the first lady that the more we want you can add at that time
D :  Thing
D :  To do is
D :  Colour is no
C :  Crazy this design
D :  And design and there
B :  Yeah but but but but
B :  Uh it in there are uh when this is closed
D :  Yeah
B :  Build also uh a cover up the l. c. d. screen
C :  Yeah yeah yeah
D :  Yeah it is basically to do that
B :  But the l. c. d. screen i mean it's a very
B :  Oh ah
B :  All in high attracting feature with
D :  Actually it then you're watching the t. v. and then you're watching anything on this into that you hardly get up what what is this is a year you know
C :  Like city
D :  Yeah you want to
D :  Uh and did you said protection do the l. c. d. a. beginning you colour but that okay
D :  You support ish in because then it falls down or something
D :  It is it's easy it's easy to use it but it's more robust at the rate
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh yes
B :  More robust
B :  Yeah okay
D :  I've yeah and you have a good chance is
C :  There's no way if you have to see in the the the components to put inside israel oh wait
D :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  So those are costs is it actually a bit more it's uh
C :  It's it's sixteen francs
B :  It's
A :  It's
D :  Six
D :  Sixteen year olds
C :  Sixteen euros uh
B :  Okay
A :  That's what are the budget then
C :  Then it's o. to budget but the the main point we you we don't want that we do um money for true
C :  And this a basic do that the uh at a star system would be
D :  Yes
C :  Uh something or three francs but item
D :  There you go
C :  So you also
C :  And uh
A :  That's on top of the sixteen or as a part of that
C :  No no no part of that
D :  Part of that
A :  So things and a thirteen year so that the speech recognition
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
D :  Yeah
D :  But there
D :  It's here we can i have uh if you have your more ideas we can add more some more keys if you want me to know
D :  Okay
C :  I think the the yeah we should
C :  Stick with uh a number of
A :  Hmm
C :  To use because it if we add too much and
D :  Yeah it's it's not be plate thing up here it is
A :  Was this on the side
D :  I that's for that it's can have the l. e. d. for indicating your battery
A :  Okay
D :  And that sort of it's a like a blinking landing and keep it that's right
A :  Well i started around a lot uh
D :  Yeah
A :  The size and that that's right
B :  Mm be before dark talk about the money and what's possible and what
A :  Uh-huh
B :  It's not possible maybe yeah you can
B :  Uh give our uh give this you or uh
A :  Okay well we don't need a racial buy the products when they stay
B :  Yeah so i have a way as liberation and also the evolution criteria uh so what
A :  Okay but
B :  What is important to look what
A :  There's a lot of talk about already um
A :  From the marketing point maybe
A :  We some actual that we've take into account
B :  Well just
A :  Yep
B :  To quickly if it if we all
B :  Already
A :  So is this a list of criteria on
A :  Um mm the thing that we identify the thing important to sell in the product
A :  Um we discuss three days and write them as a great
A :  And at the end will make an evaluation based on that side is an average the score those
A :  Items uh
A :  Uh-huh these are things identified as being important
A :  Um
A :  Those are the three things were the look and feel innovation an easy to use
A :  The three important components
A :  Um it to integrate demographics are using those things in the right way
A :  To give a demographic
A :  And then do it for the company motto
A :  Find the fashion trends and put it into the product as well
A :  So gonna go through and do is on the
A :  The table it's not don't discuss them further and then evaluate them
B :  Um
B :  No no one and what not discuss the discourse it now
A :  Okay
A :  So just what does what what i guess
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So the first one was really very fat low budget
A :  We do want to check the price down
A :  Again products the point that would just have a high profile or not
A :  As for your mike at that euros then we have a
B :  Um well
B :  My my personal feeling is uh what what what when this one is eight euros
B :  We must like how can we prove it
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And then
B :  I mean
B :  Who was just see it if we can still spend this
B :  For half euro
B :  And
A :  Yep
B :  To work because
B :  The the the the
B :  They're selling price is already
B :  Plastic uh quite fixed on twenty five euros
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So we just
B :  Have all four as much as
B :  Yes
C :  Oh sorry
B :  Well value for the for the customer uh you can have for twenty five euro
A :  He's looking tail innovation
A :  One
D :  No it to you easy to use
C :  Easy to use
C :  Audience target
A :  And trends
A :  Oh you call in the idea of using the um removable covers on this
A :  Uh that have both our
B :  Um well what we can still discuss that
A :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  And together which evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas uh i mean that adding things or the removing a lot of options because they are
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Expensive
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
B :  I've received
B :  Huh
B :  A framework
B :  Which we can
B :  Do this i mean
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Did you have to use a basic excel sheet
D :  No
B :  No okay this is the design d. v. d. the latest price for for our production uh
B :  Uh
B :  It's a unit
B :  Four
B :  Several components so
B :  We can uh a
B :  See where the the the prices if we need twelve euro uh fifty cents a
B :  So maybe we can start with this uh calling this one
A :  That's the thing
B :  But this is the first design
A :  That was going
B :  Yeah
A :  I guess the look and feel
A :  Well um
A :  Hmmm one is
A :  A perk depending and
B :  There is another pen
A :  Yeah on
A :  Um
A :  Mm
A :  Ones that and seven is the best
A :  That one is true and seven is false one semester
B :  Okay
A :  So a scale of one to seven
B :  Okay
B :  So look-and-feel
B :  Well you already feel that uh pretty much i think
D :  It's fancy
B :  In a in my opinion
A :  Uh-huh
B :  If you really feel is
A :  Uh-huh
B :  It's very good
B :  Very good in your hand so ah ha ha i would consider two or or maybe maybe you can one
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  For field but that's just also we should also put a look
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And then
B :  It it looks
B :  Quite
B :  Conventional
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And you'd be
D :  Yeah
A :  One's got a clean
B :  So
A :  Functional and is
A :  That's a that's a looking at so
B :  The minimum and it's a safe five
B :  I use my opinion but
B :  I don't know what
D :  While i was given money
D :  Yeah i do with the video design this like this stuff
A :  Uh-huh
D :  That's a serious
C :  Yeah
D :  You know
D :  It the the look is fine but that's true
D :  Are we doing for in that you know
C :  Yeah for maybe
A :  Cool
D :  For yeah that's
B :  Now would that then we still a four
D :  Yeah
D :  Okay yeah
A :  It's not
C :  Uh
B :  Okay maybe sixty or
C :  You should for it like this not like this uh new
A :  That's the
D :  No i can get the batteries none of that c. s. phone and i'll have to
A :  Thanks right
A :  That is that is that the ink
A :  But that's that that that one
A :  Yeah
D :  No no it's not that it's not that was about that
C :  Okay
D :  Yeah no should use
A :  I think it's lost a battery
B :  And tried right
A :  Nice
B :  How do want
A :  Is to write the wouldn't pick it up with the senses
D :  It and and the battery there
D :  Oh yeah
A :  That's it
C :  Try
A :  Well we were gonna tell
B :  Yes it does have to
D :  Ah
C :  Perfect
A :  Is that working
A :  Yeah
B :  Good good
A :  Logo see it still it it wasn't working this is no whiteboard marker that would be picked up on the
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah sure what what
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
A :  Mm
B :  So
B :  Then then
A :  And the other one
C :  Wow
A :  Uh this like that
A :  The types of missed that uh same
B :  I i
B :  When we want to include uh i'm doubting about this this components
B :  Breaks in europe
C :  Came maybe
D :  No i put this in that there's not going to work you actually
A :  Okay
D :  It's a it's a it is good
C :  Is that the button it's the led
D :  It could lead actually which which will be coming in it so
C :  Like it actually yeah it should be um but it
B :  Mm
D :  It's it'd be a better there so it won't be the only in all
C :  But you can
D :  For shooting or something
C :  Push it again you can push it
A :  Yeah that thing is the is the left "'em" under cheating "'cause" if people are left-handed on these other hands
D :  Yeah um
A :  Maybe it won't work so well
D :  No i uh it's it's not protruding and the u. to go in but it into that
B :  Well our
A :  I'd say two or three that one in some way
B :  Mm
A :  What was was three into
B :  I think the look is better but the feel if it were so so i i would also say that this or
A :  Okay
B :  But what do you
B :  Do you think
D :  I it's fine i think
D :  Night that that um the feel it that
D :  Um
D :  You'll is a value you don't see their feet because at the phone number that that that's it quite inside
D :  Normally it's not it's embedded one
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
B :  Yes
D :  This is all the numbers on it
B :  Yeah as in basically it's the same shape
D :  Yeah it's a base it is you do the same thing actually
B :  Uh-huh
D :  You'll be
D :  Except that in this
C :  And they c. d. makes it better
D :  Yeah and you might as well i think for for whatever
B :  Yeah uh
C :  So i would say
A :  Yeah it is it on and off as in that one
D :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah okay that
C :  I would say two or three
A :  Okay
A :  So a consensus two or three
B :  That's yes
D :  So thing right
A :  Um innovation
A :  This one
A :  Not that much
C :  Basically there is no innovation the first one compared to what
A :  Hmm
C :  Exists in the market
D :  Now but
D :  For the design of the stuff
C :  Yeah those of uh anything
D :  This is this
D :  I
D :  You should be i
A :  Is it actually clear including like
D :  Oh
A :  A location kind of thing i try to find it
D :  I dunno i think it's more of the field
A :  There's nothing at that
A :  But there's a there's no actual innovation that or sisters that our remote control
D :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  They only have a innovation is the shape
D :  Say about that
A :  I guess
B :  So that
A :  So there's a red does that look and feel can also technological innovation
C :  Yeah yeah alright
D :  Yeah
A :  So i'd be out to seven for
C :  Yeah
A :  Innovation
C :  And uh
C :  And the second one is really uh instead of the art
D :  Yeah
C :  Um in terms of innovation
C :  Um no um
C :  With many it more functionalities and
C :  Can
C :  A plan and caused uh
D :  Yeah it is it
C :  Oh numpads
B :  Yeah uh uh l. c. d. screen
C :  Yeah
B :  That's that's
B :  Well quite
C :  And all of the scrolling uh
C :  Buttons and then you know and for a for a device behind this
C :  Uh could pretty that
C :  One or two weeks
A :  Okay
C :  That's right
D :  Yeah
A :  So what is what the innovation this call the l. c. d. screen
C :  Uh
C :  Yeah uh to make speech recognition
A :  Is that in this one now is is "'cause" this is the
D :  Not only
A :  Do do two two options we discussed then we discussed one those imagine a mono that the budget
B :  It just escape to discuss it as you all designed it and then we will will
A :  Okay
A :  So it the cost will is what uh
B :  Uh that in the budget
A :  Well the cost for the first one i it's yours
C :  Aides
C :  Well actually we have
C :  Yeah to check again yeah
D :  Yeah it is oh yeah
A :  Uh this one was sixteen years
C :  Sixteen
D :  Fifteen euros
A :  Okay so uh
A :  Innovation for this one is too
A :  One
D :  That'll they would say a two
C :  And to be one what would do we need actually i i don't see uh
B :  Wipe this one
C :  Okay a one would would be with that but
D :  I
B :  Am i
A :  Hmm
D :  Yeah
A :  Well it is recognition is a very good innovation of a that's a
C :  Yeah
C :  So maybe you can
A :  Is it is
B :  This table with the speech recognition
C :  He's using speech recognition
D :  Right yeah
B :  Get get in depth
A :  Give it a one
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  I think it's ah i see
B :  One
A :  Okay
A :  Is it yes
D :  Uh
C :  So the first one is or or e. stand out so everybody include
A :  Mm
D :  Easy to use we uh
C :  Oh grandmothers
A :  Yeah
C :  Can use it
D :  They're used to it to me
A :  So that's maybe at the two for ease of use
C :  Yeah
D :  He out there may it
C :  Um
C :  That's the other one is quite easy so low
D :  Be you do it has more functionality i think it shouldn't be for the use that a lot need to actually
B :  Hmm
D :  It shouldn't be
A :  So maybe
A :  The three or four
D :  Uh yeah back to the effect
D :  I think
D :  To be
D :  Yeah it
C :  When me and you maybe sometimes people get
C :  Uh scared with the number of buttons
D :  Yeah but
C :  And there's a way i would say three yeah mm
D :  When be either do is the key is actually if you see
A :  Three of all
B :  Three i would
D :  So it's fine okay
C :  Yeah because it's now
C :  So that could be one with a one on the buttons as well
D :  Yeah is it actually the user has to put some effort to do use that it's really it's not so easy like this one the more more
B :  Yeah but then when when you use used to it
B :  It is quite easy
D :  It's quite easy get immediately that that a lot of that
A :  Okay
D :  Yeah
B :  What what's next
A :  So it's very sad how well it goes to that i didn't graphic
A :  So it was talking to a four year olds that
B :  Twenty to forty yes that's it
C :  There's one would be uh for one lot of
A :  Hmm
D :  No that's what i i would i would give this wanna do the old people like to
C :  Yeah my mother's yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  So should they change that demographic that is uh power than the funky and they
B :  Well except except for surfing shape mean that's
C :  Yes
C :  Yeah
B :  That's something with
B :  Has an appeal on this group of thing
A :  It was very one price range of that kind of another one which at the same thing
A :  And i can imagine it being
A :  Applying to the video graphic yeah
A :  That's it still
B :  Would
B :  Week after this week and can consider the forces making this more attractive to
A :  And as it were and uh some budget that uh
B :  To the great
A :  And a few things that's right
B :  But as it is now and
B :  It's a
B :  Six
C :  Yeah
D :  Well it
B :  Do you agree
A :  And
D :  Like mm but i mean
C :  Maybe "'cause" it's so important you see it was written at least when put on the um
C :  The uh look different than uh taking care of feeds you die gets the right
C :  Orange
C :  Of people
D :  I yeah but ready to sell it in the market it's pretty cheap actually
C :  Yeah but
A :  As can be cheap whatever that was that was it was
D :  And people chance to decide to use a cheaper one
C :  Yeah
D :  It's enough to
C :  But for us it's uh yeah we have a concern that we need to set twenty five euros
B :  Hmm
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Or not and all that nice and extract a euros and that one now the number one
B :  I just think twenty five euros i mean it's not gonna be cheaper
D :  Okay
D :  Okay so in that case where it's fine okay
B :  Hmm mm okay
A :  Um and the democratic demographic of the second one
D :  The demographics
A :  It got that that that that wasn't that's got the l. c. d. screen and
B :  Yeah that that that that that and i think it's better because of the l. c. d. screen was really not be all on the on the on the east
A :  Yeah
B :  On the yeltsin on the
C :  Yeah i mean if you want to to get a flu
C :  We we should to to settle for millions of this so i think for this uh guns we need absolutely b. s. c. d. screen
B :  Hmmm so
B :  E. l. c. d. screen uh attracts
A :  Uh especially if we can then have an l. c. d. screen and load range but that's good
B :  Maybe maybe that's
B :  Something to go through so
B :  What what what
A :  And we go with three and that one
D :  Yeah i think it's uh it has more
D :  Mark it actually
C :  Even one and two one
D :  Yeah e. r. r.
A :  Okay yeah
C :  Yeah true
D :  That's true yeah because
D :  More all this will be more appealing because you can add a lot also us to use and on that
D :  Because
D :  You you have a did you have a lot of things which you can include for the p.
A :  As as i guess this is the speech recognition as well
A :  And that makes it more killings more of a
A :  And you find a way
D :  We had a pack to get it tested the c. v. s. to tell you
D :  Oh good
B :  Okay fine a point
A :  And
D :  Just send
A :  Well in the trends the trends were uh
A :  The fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  So i as it is not really doing either them
B :  I think
C :  Spongy
C :  Um that mean that it goes easy know what i have
A :  Well it's funny to be part of the the feel the buttons as well uh it's um
A :  Each other but a point about the kind of spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but
C :  Um
A :  And if you wanna nokia's it's got like
A :  You can have the individual buttons as got just a
B :  Hmm
D :  Yeah
A :  Want it on that and so you can if that is how spongy
C :  The do something with this feature right
C :  Spongy buttons
D :  Yeah i v. d. v. d. v. d. i'd say that we could be okay
A :  Uh so that yeah
C :  So
A :  Okay
B :  Hmm
C :  And that maybe the colour well we can make it
C :  Uh for uh and veggie
A :  But as c. d.s and the colours
B :  And uh then we go
A :  Was this one
B :  We can we can consider uh huh
B :  Is it possible this a two
B :  Make it cover
B :  Fourth so it's phone i mean
A :  Well the back of my well sort of it that much
D :  But i do want a colour that it should be in that there are remotes
B :  We'll just with the with the flexible plastic yeah
A :  So you get the option of having to tell the different textures
C :  Yeah this is plus or
D :  Uh
D :  Alright
D :  Yeah sure
D :  Yeah i think that it should be possible like what to do it in one or yeah
B :  Or or or just two things which can be
B :  Put on each other
C :  Yeah exactly like a nokia phone
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Oh yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Good luck
B :  So
B :  Maybe we can
B :  We have decided we can
D :  Oh
B :  The fancy look
B :  Or vegetables for instance
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Two
B :  To be sick or four cents now try to invest in the in the in the features
A :  I think that
A :  If we do the colour that's really and i'm the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics
A :  Simple it like this session
A :  Even next year when fruit and veg was not be out
A :  So we have a new car uh and then all still be impression
C :  Yeah
C :  "'cause" sometimes look at these go into the thing is that up it's all or black
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And uh it's quite conventional and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like
A :  Uh-huh
C :  There's one button to be yeah
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So maybe we could do
C :  Like in the one to the set of
A :  Hmm
C :  What group or was a black one
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Wrist on that one
C :  That meets the
C :  The requirements of the search people that want to respond out of things
A :  Uh-huh
A :  And then have the option of having different colours
B :  Yes that's it so that that would make be trendy call so we
A :  Oh covers
B :  We we we had don't have
A :  Uh-huh doesn't yeah
A :  That's the that's the data that could be included in either of them
A :  Although it is more with as many buttons on them
C :  Yeah so uh uh point better for the uh
B :  Yes please
A :  On the other one
A :  Okay sorry
C :  For the number two
A :  Two and three oh when i say
B :  Yes
D :  Yeah it's
C :  Ah
B :  Say say one too
D :  One
B :  One two
B :  Oh well that's you
B :  So
B :  This one a sponsor but buttons
D :  Yeah it says that
C :  And the one a spongy
B :  Hmmm i see yeah okay
A :  I guess a very true that is
A :  Or a six
A :  Nine about a five
A :  So eh
B :  Just at it
C :  Nine
D :  One point six one time
A :  Number five one points and it's
D :  I'm twenty eight yeah
A :  So on them and thirteen
A :  Nineteen twenty one
D :  All point
A :  Well fine that's four point three
D :  Oh well one
C :  We're good
A :  Okay
A :  Was to add a different price list is that are not really compare we anyway
B :  Uh-huh
B :  We we missed
C :  Yeah it's right yeah
B :  Try to get in clothes for
A :  Yep
D :  Well
B :  Oh okay okay
B :  Or we just have to choose and adapt
B :  When we choose for this one we have to uh
B :  We have to make it more attractive
B :  And which one which too big for this one we have to make more cheap
A :  Well it is it might that one cheaper by saying the speech recognition out
A :  They like to take a stand to
B :  Yes well
A :  The budget
B :  Uh but i'm not
B :  Did did you work with the same price as a five year
C :  So i i give yeah i just give a call with um money for each other
C :  And i explained um and that to me that could be possible for sixteen euros
C :  Uh unfortunately we didn't see it this chip
D :  Yeah and yeah
C :  Uh
C :  Matthews so maybe we have to recap
C :  This one
D :  Maybe you have that you could to do it with this yeah
B :  Well uh yes we'll read read that's it so let's let's try to to mould this this phone in this sheet
D :  Mm
B :  Uh what kind of energy source uh i we didn't speak about that
B :  It's a it's a normal battery or
D :  Yeah it might be you do need a a more than the management
D :  One
D :  It won't be a
D :  This
D :  Maybe you might use it a battery or three
D :  What do you say
D :  Where
C :  For this one is a normal battery
B :  Yeah this so one or three
B :  Okay
B :  Oh drawings and all but given speech recognition i think
B :  Should go for the advanced chip
D :  Yeah
C :  Uh some part of speech yeah yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  Yes well sample sensor yeah
C :  Some but yeah this one
B :  Yes yes oh okay
B :  Case
B :  Um
C :  So
D :  So double curve yeah it
D :  It's a
B :  I i see
B :  Double curved
A :  Yeah it's gonna be more just the basic a step away
C :  So which one are we putting too
D :  I don't know these are the
C :  Well
A :  Either of them
B :  Well we have we are talking about them but they have the same shape but
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
A :  But but gonna be not basic cases
B :  So did did this would be double curved
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay
B :  Uh plastic would be uh
A :  Yeah the basic one
B :  Material
C :  It is your front
D :  Special colours
D :  Ooh
B :  Uh special colour now we need to the covers
D :  Ah
A :  So no it going
A :  But no l. c. d. l. c. display
B :  Mm yes
C :  A c. d.s yeah yeah
C :  It's okay it's a it's
A :  Is that
A :  Price per unit all for the whole
D :  Oh i know
B :  Yeah i dunno this this pair a pair unit
A :  So we made
B :  Number of components
D :  Yeah we made be the scroll-wheels right for that
C :  No it's for this one is true
D :  Not for that but also
C :  That sort of
B :  So
D :  Yeah that's that's colours
B :  One two three four five six seven eight nine
B :  Yes well i'm right
B :  So this comes to eighteen
A :  Hmmm and that's a any special button supplements
D :  Yeah once for really need it
B :  So
A :  So we have special colour special form a special material them
A :  All set of buttons
D :  Well
B :  So i think but but do you agree that that is
C :  What you mean it it's it's not double curved it's in your cup right because it's
C :  There is no like
A :  But i thought would be kept on to it says curve the size and get them to bomb as well as laptop
B :  Yes and i'm not i'm not
B :  Or
C :  Where
B :  Yes i as i understand what you mean yeah
C :  I don't think you know if this feel like this so
C :  Is there is on a. yeah
C :  Is it easy there is nothing like you know in the other stuff that they are
A :  You to read concave
C :  Yeah okay
C :  So i think we can put uh
A :  It is single curve
C :  Single curved thing sixteen
C :  That makes
C :  Uh seventeen and whether this but
C :  Buttons we have twelve buttons are you sure yeah
A :  We have all the that's the scroll-wheel on the side and yeah
C :  So i had about the um
D :  But it's that's right
B :  What would it
C :  Base station
B :  We have
B :  And talk about the led but that's not the the light this area
B :  Inexpensive believe but it's not a list
A :  No scroll-wheel for the volume that way or the some other thing is that on there
B :  Oh how to use these a scroll-wheel rest is that that sort of button which can be
C :  No no
B :  Pressed on two sides uh
B :  So for
B :  Or no
A :  Okay well uh fibres like i said wrap it up pretty fast
C :  Yes can scroll right
A :  So as a more than the um
A :  The cost to get the sixty years
B :  Mm
C :  Okay some but isn't that yeah
D :  Ah
C :  Um
C :  Where is that yes oh yes yes mm
D :  That is the sample sensor and sample speaker
B :  So
B :  Um
C :  That's true yeah it's
D :  We just need that
D :  Okay
B :  Or uh
D :  We need one
B :  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip
B :  But then we can have be nice speech recognition yes yes
C :  No we cannot yeah
C :  So
B :  So when we yeah
C :  But the um
B :  This would this would be getting the speech recognition
C :  Yeah but if you have the new their c. d. you can um
C :  True's said it between uh in uh in the universe or between all would you would t. v. and v. c. r. and it's need uh need the advanced chip
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Right now yeah
D :  Well i see
C :  Or you touch it
D :  I think it's going to do that yeah yeah
C :  I think a we're gonna a two day we can do that too
D :  With a regular chip yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Eight or or more
B :  Regular chip
C :  Okay
D :  Yeah
B :  But still fifteen so
C :  Still
C :  And what was the number of buttons buttons um
B :  And yes that that maybe
C :  But
B :  Well we can just say
C :  Matthew
D :  Ah
C :  That's
B :  One
C :  When you look at this with this uh
C :  Item
D :  Yeah
B :  "'kay" what we had just when we just want to uh uh
B :  Two cats number buttons we have to make a seven to to fit in twelve twelve fifty
B :  So is it possible
A :  And that is seven basic buttons uh a seven buttons are there any ads on
A :  But that special colours all for more material
D :  One v. then you know how to us the use of the plus it so it's
C :  You gonna make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really
D :  Okay
B :  Not that easy
C :  He little no
D :  Oh
B :  Ah
A :  So i guess it replace it is three francs
A :  For a three year it's
A :  By itself
B :  Uh-huh
C :  And uh we don't want to change that right we we wanna i see the other otherwise we wouldn't but get the market
D :  Right
B :  All the lights you
C :  It's very don't think
B :  You at your office very normal huh
B :  Yeah like this
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So it
C :  And i don't know
A :  Twelve euro fifty lot to offer the battery can do it in at that
A :  So ten fifty
A :  To l. c. display display that send fifty
A :  Um so i send it to you to useful
A :  Case and the the buttons
A :  And the chipset chips
A :  Okay ready
A :  So we have scale as down here within budget but then at at that
C :  So what what what each of those thingy what they
C :  Because it's a major point is c. d.
C :  Um
C :  Using it simple um
D :  All be could even be play them but but then there's a bit
C :  Because sometimes what when you was the t. v. in fact
C :  You have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands i don't know i'm just
D :  I actually depends it depends a lot can uh five and as you want i didn't do it
C :  I think
B :  Hmm
D :  For example if you had to more fine now did then but do you add two more buttons that
D :  Is that have l. c. d. display
A :  Yeah
D :  That is that is going to be in the colours like two two euros at least
A :  Unless we can really drop the prices down we need here the l. c. display
D :  Okay so we can get rid of it and then
D :  I had a couple of buttons
C :  But um
C :  What do we want that
C :  On the market point of view yeah what do you think uh a c. d.s
C :  A major all
C :  Feature know
B :  Hmm
A :  For the price is can be board can afford and it'll not a cat for the l. c. display is a way to get in there
A :  Uh
B :  Think we have to come to decision now that's i i think we would what we just the way it is false
B :  About the u. i. d. l. c. d. uh display so
C :  U. s. in you wanna the market you worked what right okay
B :  Yes
B :  Yes yes
C :  Okay
B :  One man one vote
B :  So we'll think c. d. l. c. d. c. d. display should be it'd be in it
A :  I'd i'd like to to be a markov see happening as you mean
D :  I think that
A :  Pat but uh uh these are anyway as project manager
B :  Uh-huh i know but
C :  Yeah right
D :  Yeah but they are letting you that what it does mark to provide that if you want included back
A :  That what we had make decision now
B :  So uh uh a cat have an l. c. d. c. display is just uh uh have very very limited number buttons
B :  Is that except all yeah
B :  Can i can functions be implement yeah
C :  Yes
B :  You you
B :  You agree
D :  Well i i i uh
B :  So at at having seven buttons instead of twelve
D :  Yeah
B :  So that would be would be cutting cutting so say about be buttons
C :  Because one
C :  Yeah it it's a minute
C :  Uh actually we could
C :  And start remove it for buttons
C :  And have a three
C :  Uh possibilities for each of the three yeah
C :  Here one of them in there and uh
A :  Hmmm i think there were were really losing easy to use
C :  But um
C :  Okay
D :  That really good another problem
D :  Of the people to use it
D :  Isn't going to be the
C :  Okay
D :  Doing that
B :  So um i i think we should use we got the l. c. d. screen
B :  That that's that's my opinion
D :  Well it's okay you uh a cat that's it is yeah and it is to more buttons
A :  Okay
A :  So l. c. is that the speaker yeah now we have
C :  The speech recognition is out
B :  Um where it's
C :  Because of the budget
B :  Okay well we know now we can just
A :  So i basically back to the original one now but that that's better
A :  Which can lead to be on budget
A :  Exactly pretty much
D :  Yeah
A :  We did you costings
C :  Yes
A :  So it just look at the get on a look at that one now
C :  Yeah
B :  Yes yes i've i've i think we we just go for this one and that that our twelve euros fifty a
B :  He's price okay my uh
A :  Okay was that
B :  My supervisor will would lead that's fifty cents
C :  I see yeah or we don't need uh really uh expert designers
B :  Cheaper than this
A :  So
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
C :  Um because them oh yeah
A :  Well wouldn't that i can talk to that slide maybe it's even drop the prices down to enter key what things in that
A :  That's all we can do it that or do we have an alignment
B :  Okay good
B :  Then we have are the same
B :  Thank you
D :  Oh okay
B :  That was it
D :  That's it
C :  Thanks
D :  Cool
A :  Okay
D :  Oh
A :  Mm
C :  Hmm
D :  Hmm
B :  Mm
D :  Yeah
D :  It's mm
