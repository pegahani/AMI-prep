A :  Okay
A :  Alright yes again straight back to business here
A :  Um
A :  The selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five euro
A :  And our profit aim is fifty million euro
A :  We're going to make this an international product market it in the states in europe in asia
A :  And um
A :  I production cost to make that profit is gonna be max of twelve fifty euro per remote
A :  Okay
A :  So we're gonna talk for a little while um hear some topics that we might be able discuss expect our experiences with remote controls um
A :  Our first ideas about this new remote anything that you can bring to the table for this project
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Last r. s. off anybody have anything to offer
C :  Mm
B :  Well we wanna make a multifunctional remote way
A :  Right
B :  One remote for everything
D :  Right
C :  And everything being
C :  Wait we have
B :  Um
C :  But sound system
C :  T. v.
C :  D. v. d.
C :  Be a chance
C :  Uh t. bell
B :  I think they'll be facing v. h. s. a. shortly
D :  Yeah it's you know
A :  To you though
C :  But it's still there so
B :  Okay
C :  For gonna do it
D :  It needs to be compatible "'cause" universal remote controls are never universal
A :  They're never universal that's right it's a special if you buy uh
A :  Uh
A :  Not be product d. v. d. player say usually doesn't work if it's not one
C :  I have just a like a sony if it's like a
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Okay
B :  So we'll have to figure out how to cover all the different
A :  I mean concerns
B :  Variances in signals
D :  Oh we need insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your
A :  Yeah
D :  Interactions to go with remote anyways
A :  Okay and um another thing that i think it's important is
A :  That the design of the product how it feels in your hand
A :  If it's just flat and kinda boring
A :  Does don't
A :  Nobody wants to buy those anymore they want ergonomic ones
D :  They want the flashy like it's a like a skin from las vegas
A :  Yeah
A :  Ones that
A :  Ones that look
A :  High-tech to do
C :  But at the same time simple
D :  Yeah
A :  Right
A :  So that people like my mother can use
B :  Do something with the curvature or like that matches the curvature of the hand
A :  Yeah
C :  Mm
A :  Okay
A :  Anybody have any experiences with remote control that they can remember that
C :  This past half
A :  Yeah true that's true
C :  Um
B :  What kind of battery would we wanna use
B :  Because battery changing is usually
C :  Double a.
D :  Double a.
B :  Yeah
A :  This enemies triple a.s though
D :  Yes um is triple a.s so double or triple
C :  So on but
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah i guess that that's
C :  We nice teacher play we can but but people use they have the ways around
A :  Okay yeah
A :  But that has to do with the size of a two
B :  Yeah
A :  Well well as long as we know that issue is
D :  Yeah for want it to be more sedentary probably go with the triple a.
A :  Here we can
A :  Triple a.
B :  Kevin go with a small lithium battery
A :  But
A :  It's okay we don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type in size is important
C :  Uh-huh mm
A :  Okay anything else
A :  Right uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh close the meeting
A :  Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes
A :  Here's what we're going to do

A :  Okay
A :  I
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  Okay in u. i. d.
C :  Uh-huh
A :  The technical fun functions design making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it
A :  Operating all those different things
A :  Okay and the marketing
A :  Per se
A :  Courtney is going to do the user requirements specification
A :  I guess that means specifying um what exactly
A :  The user is going to be looking for right
