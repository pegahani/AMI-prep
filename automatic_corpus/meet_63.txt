A :  Play-doh as edible you know that
A :  It's definitely
D :  Because kids
B :  I used to you to
C :  I have a definite you know the phone and now is edible
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  But um it's it's made edible "'cause" yeah
A :  Is is to prove
D :  To make the double "'cause" conceded and if this was an edible them
A :  Yeah
D :  Well no more babies
C :  I see that makes sense because i remember like
C :  Be better off my mom every day and i remember people's mom's making like um a play doh where you just like make the you use colouring and then make some sort of
C :  So that uh
A :  Yeah
D :  Oh yeah this yeah
D :  Right
A :  Okay
C :  Mm
A :  Why is everybody everybody ready
C :  Yep
B :  Yep
A :  Okay let's have your own um
C :  We've got some it
A :  Let's get guys have the yeah presentation
B :  We're gonna call product like
C :  Yeah
C :  It's pretty exciting
C :  So
C :  Everything that that we wanna do we want it to be ergonomic and to be
C :  A lot of rubber
C :  Very simple and easy to use
B :  Double curved
C :  Yeah double curved um but also something that was gonna do about people something to be different uh
A :  Nice
C :  Separated from the other
C :  Remotes got on the market
C :  So uh
C :  I think if you put this in the palm of your hand
C :  You'll see what a nice thing we have gone yeah
A :  I
D :  That is cool
C :  So basically
C :  If you hold it like that
C :  The one on your thumb
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
C :  The thumb button is the power button
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Your index finger is channel up
C :  No fingers channel down
C :  Ring finger is volume up
C :  You think he's volume down
D :  Was a big good thing
C :  That's the log button as well
D :  Oh oh
C :  Uh on a banana "'em" as a mute button
C :  And also has digit
A :  Was as to what button and
D :  And newt
C :  For muting yeah
A :  Um neat
C :  Um
C :  And then
D :  I am
C :  And you can also there's a numeric keypad on top so you can keep directly to the
A :  Okay
C :  To the channel if you want
C :  So it's really basic functionality is as far as what keys are available but i think it's very comfortable and very innovative and
C :  It looks different
A :  That's i think that was
C :  So all that i mean important cues or eight years
C :  You're right it um
C :  Yeah it can be in place for you to to access them
C :  So you don't you
B :  Which is and anti r. s. r. i.
C :  Yeah
A :  Hmm
C :  It should be
C :  And it's also can for mobile to the size of your hand i mean if it's too big it's the rubber
C :  Remote so you can you know
A :  Yeah
A :  It's great
C :  Change that
D :  So
C :  So
C :  Is that uh
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  My sure what you guys were hoping one and for are expecting or that's it
A :  Um well um
A :  Thing about it
A :  But it's a small think they're mean we'd have to make
A :  I'm right handed one and i left and this one
C :  Uh
B :  Alright yeah
C :  That's good thinking yeah
A :  But
A :  That's that as to why that's not possible
C :  If we build rocket ships we can we do that can do that right yeah that that
A :  Yeah
C :  And that's
A :  And i left and it's is it is yeah
D :  Yeah but then
C :  Yeah i don't i don't think about that but yeah
C :  Okay
D :  But then you can learn to use you're right click i was thinking it's it's left and design right-handers in the family
D :  Want to have two remotes
A :  Yeah yes
B :  Yeah no i know people who have left handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer
B :  For the whole the same computer for the first family and to have a mouse and everybody's using right handed
A :  Sure sure
D :  Yeah
D :  I'm sure they'll be able to
D :  I mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary i think it would be compatible with the left and right hand side
B :  Imagine that are you right-handed
A :  Yeah
B :  Imagine it did it with your left hand i don't think it's too
D :  Yeah it's not
B :  But we can have
B :  Wolf uh
D :  Yeah
D :  Have them in stock
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Make a more appealing
A :  But um other than that i mean i'm at some you know
A :  That's just something i think i think it's great yeah great idea
C :  Do you think it says
C :  R. r.
B :  Or have to get the oh i
A :  I think it's well i see are more so it is we bring
C :  Fashion into electronics
A :  Fashion that's it to electronics i'd say that could be quite fashionable
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah it's got them the black yellow and blue
C :  Plus red which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable
A :  Yeah
C :  Uh huh
A :  I
B :  Uh yeah you got
D :  I have
A :  Yeah
D :  Mm
C :  So that's that's all are in the things about uh
A :  Yeah but it it gets come up with well you know the thing that's
A :  What we what we were looking at doing right now is the know seems to be there
C :  Yeah
A :  Well done
D :  And role playing around is yeah
A :  Um before we move on
D :  Yeah and
D :  Do about it
A :  I need that kind of a
A :  Okay
A :  Yeah um
A :  One thing i think that we need to look at
A :  Is
A :  Costs
C :  The costs as i said
B :  But that was very cheap
A :  Well yeah
A :  Ah ha ha ha
A :  And so
D :  Play the whole last very long have will go out of the physical
D :  He
C :  But it's edible
D :  Uh-huh
B :  She proof
D :  Well by more than if you can
C :  That was the main criteria from the last meeting you had to teach you proof
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Uh right
A :  Okay now i think that do this
A :  Okay do you know i can do this
B :  All whole
A :  Um why not that they're really but it's it's easy enough to go through with these are
A :  Would um for that
A :  Can i say
A :  Power
B :  Yep
A :  And for electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest
A :  Saying this inside and
A :  Oh
A :  So uh
A :  The case we've gone for the double curved
A :  Um
A :  I have made out of rubber
A :  The interface is pushbuttons
A :  And is button supplements well then
A :  Diff special colours on line
D :  Yeah
A :  So for um special colours
D :  The two full
A :  Special form yeah they're special form they're in shapes and stuff
C :  Yeah i mean these these ones on the side or curved kind of stuff
D :  And special material
A :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  And there any special material no no not not made of wood or titanium rubber i mean it just simple
B :  Rubber
D :  Well the rubber on a
C :  The buttons a rubber
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah
A :  Uh
A :  So let's say if that comes within budget
A :  Right that's
B :  But
A :  That's gonna cost that yeah that's gonna cost
D :  We're under budget
A :  Ten
A :  Ten euros seventy cents seen it like
A :  And uh thought it was it had come in under twelve fifty
C :  That's good
C :  Yeah
A :  So
C :  Right actually making a better profit and we expect a
A :  This is all very very good
A :  The bosses will be very please
A :  Okay this this side this so i can imagine
A :  Uh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  So we saved think
A :  So yeah mm
A :  No this is uh in the uh the the the uh like that works
A :  Displaying this
A :  Okay
A :  So uh that's that's me done with this but this is um to to see in there
A :  Common to what you were gonna do
D :  I think so
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah evaluation
D :  Oh yeah
D :  As well we'll get to
D :  I get back to them looks on the board
D :  Right
D :  Oh
D :  Function
A :  Yeah right
D :  Okay
A :  I still have this map later
D :  Hmm
C :  Yeah so
A :  I could talk to a could spend it
D :  Okay
D :  So
D :  Evaluation
D :  Gonna do it all together so evaluating each criteria i've got the criterias
D :  And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true so it's it it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria
D :  And the criteria is that are
D :  And how
D :  For this up on the board
D :  So we have a box
D :  To sign of true
D :  And this is false this is this like
D :  Keep you informed
D :  So seventh yeah
D :  Um one c. and then you've got in the middle
D :  So the first criteria
D :  You'll get we don't
D :  Okay good
D :  Okay that's criteria look and feel so it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it
D :  Colourwise and is it spongy
D :  So what mark so we give for that
A :  I would give it a seven
C :  Yeah
D :  As in this not
C :  Oh sorry one
A :  Oh sorry one
D :  A one a one
A :  Yeah
D :  So i'll just write criteria
D :  Criteria what
D :  "'kay"
D :  Second criteria
D :  New technology have we implemented new technology
D :  It was in the new high tech
B :  Well the kinetic thing yeah
D :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  That was i mean technological innovation well
A :  That that so
C :  Every everything else is fairly simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy was new
D :  So is that
D :  So i'll give it a
B :  Also the um
D :  Yeah
C :  It's ergonomic those are not
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah that's not a technological same as another thing it as another marketing things on the technical side of it
C :  That's the design that's a that's a that's a design thing yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  I'd say it's about a jewish
C :  It's about in in the in the middle somewhere maybe uh i dunno
B :  Two
D :  Two
D :  Three
B :  Yeah
C :  Maybe three yeah
D :  Three
D :  Across here three is
A :  Easy to use
D :  Is it easy to use i think it's a one
A :  I'd say is um not if you're left-handed it's not
C :  Yeah
D :  I think
A :  I would give it a i would give it a two
D :  Two sets
A :  Because yeah it is
A :  More k. to lie and the table left-handed people but
D :  But if we make a right handed or left hand it then
C :  If we're gonna have one left in it a one i had i dunno give it a one but otherwise otherwise it in
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Good give it to
D :  Yeah okay
D :  "'kay" criteria for
D :  Is costs so
A :  Cost
A :  I mean on the budget to us a definite one
C :  Yeah
C :  That was great
D :  Yep
A :  Man a buttons
D :  Like the amount buttons "'cause" people like a lot let black
A :  Contains only the necessary buttons
D :  So it's a one
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  Criteria six r. s. i. is a good i guess yes
A :  It's anti r. s. i.
D :  Uh i guess
D :  This one
B :  Yeah
D :  And criteria seven was the last and that they get lost is easy to get lost
B :  It's yellow
A :  I'm having is gonna get lost easily
C :  It is very bright yeah
D :  No but it is small which
C :  It's not the kind of thing that's gonna slip like between uh couch cushion or something you know
C :  You know
C :  Uh
D :  I think they would could be
D :  "'kay"
C :  You think okay lost
A :  Good to
D :  Yeah
D :  And it's not fully is not fully like you can't say i mean this a one definitely
A :  I mean it
A :  Now mean
A :  I mean it's still flush it out so that theoretically but
C :  Yeah anything i mean yeah it's better than average
C :  Well well i guess
D :  Yeah
C :  But yeah can you lost
D :  The mobiles get lost all the time
C :  Okay it's useful
D :  But then you bring "'em" in
D :  You find out
B :  Uh-huh
D :  So
A :  Okay
D :  So that's that
D :  That's evaluation so i'd say
D :  Yeah he
A :  Uh i it's all all system done
D :  It's like that
D :  Also and like a number one
B :  Tom well
C :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  Number one product
A :  You can pick a pick a bit of a week l. file
D :  Hold on folks
D :  We fit it all the criteria i i
A :  Okay wow
D :  Yeah so
A :  Well done based on
D :  So that's or
A :  Okay and
A :  I think i might just wanna put in
A :  As project manager
A :  The you know the the price for everybody here i haven't worked on it
A :  You know both individually and as a team
A :  Yeah and you know everyone's come up with our individual ideas in there and different departments
A :  Um and then come together
A :  I'm works in you know integrity
A :  You know the right times as you know especially you to you
D :  He
A :  That so you know
C :  Yeah
A :  Number of a well and and and
A :  They you know as being good communication going on
C :  Yeah there are designer there are some
C :  Six some heated heated discussion but we
B :  Uh-huh
C :  We could try to keep cool and then
C :  Just just
A :  It has got as the the corpus course gotten bass if you polls about
B :  Well
D :  But
C :  We decide that we just had the squeeze our product a little bit hmm
B :  Yeah no
A :  No
B :  I
A :  Uh huh
A :  Fantastic
C :  Uh you guys about it a great team
B :  It is true
C :  I think where the where the envy of all the whole wall yeah there are teams
D :  Okay cool
A :  I think so i you know and i think we've got we have come we've come up with something in something that hasn't been done before where we're not just rehashing old design
D :  I
D :  In fort if in in for meetings
A :  Yeah
D :  Funny all design the meetings could be this quick
A :  You know maybe this isn't a simulation maybe this is actually
A :  It's a it's like
C :  I think actually trying to find ideas for uh radio remote
A :  Sorry me or someone that that that they just yeah
A :  They they get they
D :  I
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah well but to use on this to be on the market
A :  A exactly that product and um
A :  Poker yeah we design and now we leave this
D :  Huh
A :  But uh
A :  Um
C :  So at this stage i mean this is the last meeting of the project we don't have another one after it's com com to market market or something
D :  Yeah
A :  No i think when it's meetings finished but officially then we'll get a a questionnaire
B :  Oh really
A :  And then i have
A :  Or six
D :  Just a summarising now
D :  You can apply to send this
A :  I'm a message
D :  See summary
D :  You just apply to that one
C :  So there's no way to like predict whether "'cause" we had a wee which we had it
C :  As far as our financial uh
C :  Um goals we have a specific number for profits that we wanted us fifty
D :  Five
C :  No fifty million
D :  Was a fifty five
C :  I remember
C :  But there's not a way to compute that i mean this is we saved um uh
C :  On the production cost do we know how much we were making a profit
A :  It gets kinda that was another department
D :  Hasn't to sell
A :  Well all all project was was to come up with the product
A :  Basically what the for that and just basically use it it can can
A :  Is it within budget we make it when it comes so all the other things of
A :  Have a certain
A :  You know the the profits know that that's other departments is another thing that that you work out
A :  The make them
C :  But we have a vested interest in there
C :  Profit profit sharing yeah
A :  Oh yeah the only goes in the profit sharing yeah
A :  Or or
A :  Um
A :  Yeah that's it you know with the with
D :  If it is no yeah
A :  We made with my we've
A :  Designer put that we've met we've
A :  Got a prototype is within budget it's does everything
A :  That we wanted it to do
A :  It's new it's it's so um
A :  Something that that uh that is now i already
C :  I think actually in wanna manager of this is that
C :  After the uh
C :  Yeah after this fat of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be cool cool remote you know or not
D :  Uh-huh
C :  We're not you know tying
C :  Turner card to know one morse
A :  Yeah
A :  This is fine a small and then they they say it's it's something that's kind of new looks a bit kirk if people want that it's
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah it's uh um alright then this summer
B :  I
A :  Oh i'm not a put it in one of my email side
A :  Send off
A :  Um
A :  That you know that it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes are actually to give you press the strain injury
A :  A one that's a complete opposite
A :  Yeah so that's
A :  Something that's new which is one of the quite serial else just come up with something or something you
C :  It makes watching t. v. healthy
A :  Yeah and if you know i'm a good time with the t. v. you can start about your far
A :  Kidproof
D :  Just that's that's read any of the ornaments and break them
A :  Well you can buy delimiters but you won't break that
D :  No
A :  I bet
A :  Yeah
A :  So oh no i think that some very well
B :  Mm yep
A :  Well done everybody
C :  Yeah you too
D :  Yeah mm
A :  Um thinks are on the company
B :  Cool
A :  In the corporate oh that's next to the corporate simple
A :  On the top floor that with that we will just go in that existed
A :  Uh-huh
B :  But to hear that
A :  Yeah
A :  That's it
C :  That's it
A :  Well as far as i know it's file and uh
A :  Um
D :  But we got five minute
D :  No i think it
A :  No
A :  Or one class buyer
D :  Mm
C :  I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up and have
C :  Five minutes of
C :  Sounds
C :  Should we call that yeah
A :  Yeah i guess i mean we gonna gas of uh another questionnaire
C :  Uh
A :  Um
A :  It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before
D :  No no point to
A :  But i'm not real sort of see
A :  To say that it is
A :  Um as a referral about the technology that's being used in this
A :  Sort of
A :  Using the the the pens and writing on these
A :  Special pads and all that
D :  I love it
D :  I think it's cool
D :  The wind up
D :  And um vibrating pen
D :  Cool
D :  Being watched
C :  You're moment to shine
D :  Yeah
A :  Huh huh huh huh huh
D :  Well
A :  Yeah
A :  But the uh i'd i'd mm that yeah as you said uh we are not
A :  Never seen that before yeah
A :  So we're to
A :  Whiteboard
B :  Yeah
A :  Thingy uh it's great
A :  Um put a pain with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new
A :  Thing i mean it's you know in such a new idea
A :  It would be different if it was sort of
A :  Handwriting recognition
A :  Stuff but it's it's not a speech read
A :  That'll come up on the computer screen is a picture file rather than actual
A :  Text
D :  Mm
C :  Right i think they do want to handwriting recognition a message the first step
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Low key
C :  I guess we should and this since we're off off topic
D :  Yeah
C :  Sure yeah
D :  Meeting agenda
C :  Right
A :  Yeah
