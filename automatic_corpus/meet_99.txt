A :  Yep
A :  So there's a
A :  Yes
A :  Okay
A :  This is our last meeting
A :  Um
A :  I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting
A :  Uh and then we'll have a
A :  A prototype
A :  Present a shouldn't
A :  Um
A :  Then we will um to an evaluation
A :  Uh or we'll see what what we need to have on to the yeah
A :  Criteria for the evaluation
A :  Then we'll go to the finance and see if we fall within the budget
A :  Um
A :  Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish about for that
A :  With um
A :  Any changes that we did make a or
A :  Oh play with them off alright mine
A :  Um
A :  See minutes from d. last meeting
A :  Um
A :  We looked at uh at the trends
A :  We had that would be fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel that was twice as important as anything else
A :  Um they like fruit and vegetables and the new styles
A :  Um and a spongy feel
A :  So we were
A :  Time i try to incorporate those into our prototype
A :  Um
A :  They wanted limited buttons and simplicity
A :  Um then we looked
A :  That's
A :  The uh the method
A :  Four
A :  Coming up with our own remote um looking at other
A :  Other devices
A :  Um the ipod
A :  We really like the look at that
A :  Um we also had the the kids remote for the simple idea
A :  Um a two part remote which was what we're actually looking at
A :  Uh and then um
A :  There is talk of
A :  Speak uh speech recognition uh and um becoming more
A :  Uh predominant and easier
A :  To use
A :  I think we still decided not to go with that
A :  Then we looked at d. components um
A :  The materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips
A :  Um and made a decision on
A :  What we were going to use to make a remote
A :  Um
A :  And basically it
A :  Have what we're make for the prototype
A :  So
A :  I'm going to leave it that and which you guys
A :  To go for
C :  The best that discussion
A :  Prototype yeah do you need uh this
C :  No
C :  Name is alan
B :  Can try to plug that in there but
C :  Of the banana
C :  Um
C :  Yeah basically
C :  We must not the colour yellow
C :  Um
C :  Worked on the principle of a fruit
C :  Which was mention this basic design and a banana
C :  Um
C :  But it would be held
C :  In such a fashion
C :  What is also bit off topic this way
C :  Hard plastic the usability lab uh
C :  Durable goods
C :  So that's start
C :  How to how we could
C :  How the ergonomics of it um
C :  All the controller would be done with the scroll wheel
C :  To use imaginations a bit and they say represents d. screen
A :  Very nice
C :  Well you go through and just simple functions would be
C :  Um but almost identical so my point
C :  That we might use the channels that with all the way through channels
C :  Volume up and down
C :  And then to access the more complicated functions
C :  Short-cut you press i go to the menus
C :  A simple that's just represents the infrared
C :  And been
C :  That's simple on off switch
C :  Um i dunno we could use it
C :  Voice
C :  That blue-based should be a lot to that but what about should be suppose
C :  And um
C :  That's right
C :  It's as simple as that we can make it is anything else was
B :  That's what we have that's plastic
B :  Plastic a little rubber
B :  We might
B :  Uh at some more underneath here
B :  Maybe
B :  Give it to reform i mean you're supposed to hold it like that but
B :  Um just if you grab it take it from somewhere so yeah you have some route
C :  Yeah i dunno
A :  Uh-huh
C :  But if we should work left and right and that as of
B :  Yeah
B :  Exactly right
B :  Use both
B :  Might as well
C :  The actual thing might be small
B :  Think about
B :  Think about the buttons well like either
B :  Either one
B :  Uh-huh on either side there
A :  Well but what's the button
B :  Not do it at all
C :  Just the on off
B :  It's a quick on off button that's so um
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah i think
B :  Spring important so you don't have to fiddle with that
B :  Right
B :  Um
B :  That's that um
B :  I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice
C :  Yeah
B :  Play with that or they're uh yeah
C :  It's nice and you can smell of having like that but
A :  She like to uh
B :  Right
D :  Then present
A :  Well done
D :  If if
D :  Kind of a banana
C :  Know whether or not
C :  California
C :  To the costs is another thing i suppose the day
C :  Scroll on the l. c. d.
A :  Well luckily we are going to find out
A :  That likely um
A :  Do you have a marketing
D :  I do
A :  Presentation of words
D :  Okay
D :  You guys are gonna how we do it in the evaluation of the criteria
D :  Mm
D :  So for us all just discuss some of the criteria that i found
D :  Just based on the past
D :  Trend reports that i was looking at earlier
D :  And then we'll do a group of valuation the prototype
D :  The little calculate the average score to see how we done
D :  Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at
D :  Are the complaints
D :  Um
D :  There we heard from that users who were interviewed earlier
D :  So
D :  We're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale
D :  And one is going to mean
D :  True that with the the actually achieve that
D :  What seven being false we did not see that
D :  A cat
D :  So for the first one
D :  We need to decide if we solve the problem of the users to complain about them ugly remote
C :  Yeah
A :  I think it's it definitely different than anything else out that
C :  Yeah
A :  So if they think that what is that there is oddly then yes
C :  I was at that
A :  I would say i would say most athletes breaks
C :  It's price
A :  It still has your traditional black
C :  It's curved is not was not show up
C :  And goes to that
A :  That angular
B :  I'd say
B :  Because the the ergonomics the form and stuff
B :  Yes that's definitely
B :  More beautiful than the average
B :  Have a colour
D :  I think the colour is to attract a one
B :  We don't have the same that's
C :  Some people might say it yeah
B :  That has been know that has been dictated pretty much by the company so
D :  That's right
B :  Up to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh
B :  We have not solve the problem completely v. i. v. remote because the colour is that we definitely
D :  Yeah
B :  It's nothing you can say about that i mean
B :  I much prefer something like
B :  Brash scroll mm
C :  Yeah
B :  But that form but
A :  Yeah something more modern to go
B :  Right
A :  Oh a moderate colour to go with the modern for
B :  But it's different you know want your
B :  Ah
B :  Three feet
B :  He would she l. c. d. disk display in your living room that thing from the wall
B :  To be controls on one but
D :  Um and i so do you think since we
D :  This was a
D :  Assign criteria that you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle done
B :  Yep
D :  So some good
C :  Yeah
D :  But in a three four
A :  I would say
D :  Five
D :  For this right okay
B :  Yeah
A :  Very non committal for
D :  Okay
D :  The second one
D :  Did we make it simple for new users
B :  That's very intuitive
B :  I think yeah
C :  Yeah uh-huh was that was my name my name's we have
B :  Do a one
A :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Um did a controls now match
D :  The operating behaviour of the users
C :  But yeah because we've we've put down some
C :  Basically for controls are the most common to a channel and volume
B :  Right
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And then the other ones just a massive
C :  Showing
C :  Showing for
A :  Scrolling through and select in a few
D :  So one
B :  So that's one
A :  I think that's a one
D :  If
D :  On the fourth one
D :  How about the problem of a remote being easily last one of the number one complaint
B :  Something that began that yellow you just on the user name
C :  Yeah
A :  I
D :  What do you want to or not you're not to know is that
C :  Yes bright yellow bright yellows how to use
B :  Yeah i
C :  But um if we was that
C :  If we would
C :  Speech recognition that could maybe use use that solely for the
C :  To find the thing that was
C :  We could mentioned
A :  So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
C :  Just just use to find it it's lost my cassette
C :  And then you lose them so you know so easily
C :  It's not gonna fall
C :  Like a rectangle looks like down and things that should be negotiated
A :  It is quite bright and
B :  What
C :  Yeah
C :  Maybe in the middle and therefore from
D :  Yeah
C :  I mean you know losing things in those things that people can lose
A :  Yeah
C :  I mean in any way jim baker walk away with it and then you lost it
D :  Sure
A :  But if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it there are skilled is a quite a bit
B :  Oh yeah probably
C :  Yeah
A :  Probably too
A :  If we eliminate to be
A :  Fact that you know it's impossible to get it it's not gonna be lost and
C :  Yeah
A :  It's a two
A :  With speech recognition
A :  Which of course
A :  Maybe
A :  Be changed depending on budget
C :  Yep
B :  You could add an extra
B :  Feature actually
B :  Which makes this thing
B :  Raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
C :  Yeah
B :  We could do that but that's
B :  Nothing we have thought of so far
A :  Which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a
B :  Yes
C :  Yeah true i mean just as whistling for indicating is you have a a cheap so i got that
D :  Now an alarm or something yeah
B :  Yeah and he
B :  It's based on this anti anti theft technology for two cases and stuff we have one piece that's attached real a list of a piece that start speaking
C :  Expensive
A :  Some sort of proximity you
B :  They can't cost much
B :  So what that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to
B :  Hide so we have one piece
B :  You have to go somewhere behind your
C :  And i stick it on t. v. viewers
B :  Stick "'em" behind your t. v. and the other
A :  Pre that you don't next time is that is
B :  Right
B :  That be tougher
B :  Well so your remote put uh lime your somebody stole you change your television
B :  Then offer that without taking the beautiful remote control
C :  Yeah
D :  So
D :  We have in one of these
D :  Two features we gonna say
B :  Let's add one of those features and say yes
D :  So my head that no one that but it
B :  I
B :  Two
D :  To get
D :  Uh that are we technologically innovative
B :  Uhuh
C :  I said so
C :  That it might not
B :  It's all this
C :  Remote controls with
C :  Screens on
B :  It's all just all them technology or i
C :  Yes thousand
D :  From idaho have i
A :  But i
C :  But we have a job
A :  But there's not a lot of yellow there's not a lot yellow
D :  But for remotes yeah
A :  Course that wasn't the way we're gonna force to take that colour
B :  Right
D :  Do
D :  There
C :  I mean
A :  I don't know the we are that innovative state the truth
C :  "'cause" it's still one no
B :  Yeah really
D :  How many remotes to use it like this
D :  Not to run it
A :  If we had at the screening factor
B :  I
A :  There we go up
B :  Uh
A :  Um
A :  I would say we we're probably a four
D :  Uh-huh yeah okay
D :  It's gonna hurt us
D :  Okay
D :  Um spongy material
B :  Yeah we you have that
A :  We have some spongy yeah
C :  Yeah as much as
B :  Sort of
C :  It's
C :  Major
D :  Yeah
B :  It's not a one though
A :  Yeah
B :  One would be the whole thing
A :  Yeah because that's all i got
B :  To fold and stuff
A :  These parts the grapes and perhaps the backside the bottom underneath on the back
B :  Yeah
B :  So lots of four uh it knows
A :  Probably have for most
D :  And my ass later
A :  Possibly even a five
D :  Did we put the fashion in electronics
B :  Yes
D :  I'd say we don't know
B :  And more
A :  If you're fashion is but is carmen miranda
A :  You better
B :  It well the recent fashion as a rather displayed and uh
B :  In the l. c. d. and the way he operated and perform on the colour but it definitely is
A :  That's true
C :  What with all that so yeah that
B :  Trend yeah
D :  Right
D :  Now i just
D :  "'kay" uh to calculate
D :  Thank you
D :  O. six mm
D :  Seventeen a balance
C :  Uh huh
A :  Seven is
A :  Two point
A :  Two point four
C :  So i'm wondering
D :  Well i don't um and then yeah
D :  What
D :  About
C :  Just shows that way
D :  And i was like two point four two
D :  Yeah
D :  Does that work
B :  Impressed i can do that without a calculator
C :  No i don't know
C :  And i press
D :  I dunno up
A :  And what what is d. acceptable criteria
A :  Is there like a scale that we have to get
D :  Oh no it just all made uh
D :  Take my own criteria and the value of it
D :  It's a
A :  Alright that
D :  So that's that
B :  Uh
A :  Okay uh
A :  Let's see
A :  Can we get to do the budget
A :  Numbers
A :  Yeah no that you're gonna have a budget
A :  But we do
A :  Okay
C :  You can go a long time to time that is to afford to if i change case uh
D :  Oh yeah okay
C :  Two point four two
D :  Yeah with that
D :  Not too shabby
A :  So i have here and
B :  Fifty percent you kidding
A :  Yeah
A :  We want fifty percent profit on this meeting we see that very well
C :  As well things quite a
A :  I twelve and a half euros what was the cost us
A :  Okay so
B :  It's too much
A :  That would say
A :  Of the
A :  Like this
C :  Mm
C :  Mm
A :  Uh well
A :  Okay
A :  Alright so
A :  The top and the t. s. can read that or not
A :  Like you said uh my glasses on but
A :  So we've got the energy source there's a
B :  That that
A :  Four
A :  Five six categories we have energy source electronics case
A :  Then we have a case material supplements
A :  Interface type
A :  And then the button supplements
A :  Okay so
A :  Up first well energy source we take battery
A :  Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take probably
A :  Some be either two or four
B :  Two
A :  Two
A :  Like it
B :  That for is gonna be too heavy so that that's not our problem people can change it every man
D :  If if if
B :  They want no one tell after they boss it
A :  Excellent
A :  This is consumers and
A :  Alright so
A :  For the electronics our choices are some simple chip on print a regular chip on print events chip on print sample sensor sample speaker
C :  The vance triple r.
B :  That's the advanced chip-on-print yeah
A :  We have one of those
A :  Okay and then the case is a
A :  Probably it's double curved
B :  Double curved yes
A :  Case materials are
B :  Plastic
A :  Plastic
A :  I guess it's two cents one for the top one for the bottom
B :  Mm
A :  Is the writers it just one
B :  No no it's just one
A :  Maybe it a one because of the
B :  It's just one more single mole we can do that
C :  Yes
D :  Hmm
A :  I guess it doesn't matter "'cause" the price on that one to zero which is nice
B :  Exactly right
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Special colour
B :  That's not a special colour
D :  You know
B :  Especially ugly colour but that's not special
A :  Interface type we have pushbutton scroll wheel interface
A :  Integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton and an l. c. d. display
C :  That's
C :  Yeah
A :  So we actually have
A :  The l. c. d. display
C :  And then
A :  And then is that the integrated or is it
C :  I was saying to it
B :  Yes
B :  Four of them
A :  Okay button supplement special colour
A :  Um
A :  Special of
A :  Four
A :  Special material
B :  We could of course make the buttons would do
B :  It's a mahogany or so
D :  Don't really want one
A :  Or titanium
B :  Okay it titanium
A :  The costs is all say
C :  One remote control
B :  That is just
A :  Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be too i shouldn't be attributed anything for that
C :  No that's
C :  Sorry
A :  The button supplements
A :  Um
C :  Yeah i don't know
D :  Like a blank
A :  Okay
A :  Really that one point because we run on a l. c. d.
A :  And scroll
A :  So
A :  Art all was fifteen point five
A :  Which i believe
B :  That's too much
A :  Is
A :  Like three euros over
B :  It's hard to believe mm
B :  So we'll go for the hand dynamo
A :  So the only thing better then um a banana shaped remote is one that you shake
C :  Is it
C :  What is a complete set out to the wants a mobile phone later on
C :  I just had a scroll
C :  We'll interface
C :  And the l. c. display
C :  That was i was that c. display is one of the of the uh
A :  Yeah "'cause" the
D :  I
A :  Well "'cause" we have to have all right
C :  Yeah
B :  Oh yeah let's let's face it it also depends on the software on that
B :  On the television you can have
B :  The information that this thing transmit it being
B :  Displayed on the
B :  On the screen
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Soles
B :  Um and stick with you
C :  Yeah you could maybe take out the l. c. d.s
B :  Yeah
C :  Why even if it if it comes up on that
C :  Do you sell on t. v. itself
A :  So we may not need the l. c. d.s point
C :  But as possible yeah
B :  Right
B :  You may not needed
B :  They go
A :  Uh the real
C :  Oh yeah
D :  Uh-huh going to
A :  Twelve point five
A :  Okay
A :  So we just
A :  Remove are
C :  Screen
A :  Screen here
C :  Like it'd be good i'll be easy to use
C :  In an easy to use uh
A :  You
C :  Mm
A :  Besides with the with the l. c. d. but as i well the remote
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
A :  Like total and room boy is
B :  So we can just
B :  Take away a week or whatever
C :  Oh
B :  Right
D :  What's the blue plate
B :  The central
C :  That's just we'll have yellow
D :  So that's that that is
B :  Well that's us
B :  But you know
C :  Yeah yeah he was simple
D :  Looks more like a banana
C :  Yeah
C :  False rumours other
B :  They want more criteria
A :  Okay
A :  So
A :  Costs under twelve point five euro is no we we designed it
C :  Yep
A :  Now it's yes
A :  Next slide
A :  Project evaluation
A :  Uh project process satisfaction with for example
A :  Room for creativity leadership teamwork means you ideas found
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  And yes
A :  That
A :  I think that perhaps the project evaluation it's just supposed to be complete by me but
A :  I'd like to hear your thoughts
C :  Yeah
D :  And if they want some time there
B :  Fair enough
A :  Uh i have what did you think of our project process
C :  That that's gonna draw mm mm um
B :  Great
D :  Good teamwork
B :  Half a day your remote
D :  I want something done
C :  Yeah
C :  That was the other day
A :  Yeah i think
C :  We thought you were going to where i thought
A :  Yeah we stick with a rough a little little week
A :  Or leadership was quite weak in the beginning
A :  Um
A :  Um
A :  But as the day when a long we had more idea of what we're doing
A :  Room for creativity there was that um right
A :  I think we try lot different things and um
A :  I think it was
A :  Um interesting i was you guys brought up more
A :  Uh information and studies that we were
A :  Right now with a lot of those things
A :  And you guys were together well as team
A :  And um the means
A :  Which was the whiteboard and the pen's
B :  Ships you go
A :  I had some problem with the pen i think but
D :  Minus your powerpoint
D :  Fiasco
A :  Minus you
B :  Well some my for those obviously the people are work for uh uh the the work for me um they've just yeah
D :  No i know hand
A :  But
D :  In common
B :  Had the gonna roll believe yeah
A :  Yeah whole host of employees that you would like fired
B :  Yes yes
A :  Okay in new ideas found
A :  Um
D :  Mm
D :  And
A :  Yes for the remotes maybe know or not
A :  For
C :  Technology is
A :  Technology
A :  Closing
A :  Costs are within the budget
A :  Project is evaluated
A :  Um
A :  Complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
A :  That's it
C :  Mm
A :  I still have to do my minutes for this meeting i
A :  Actually
A :  Um so that will probably be another
A :  Questionnaire coming up
D :  And then have a while
A :  And then we'll have to check with beep
B :  No
A :  Main boss whether we can
A :  What goes on after that
A :  But you never meeting
D :  Uh-huh
