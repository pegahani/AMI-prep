B :  To communicate and to
B :  Well we learn from each other's plants uh
B :  Yeah i can say
B :  Um so what
B :  We'll also try to uh
B :  Get acquainted to least tools so there are also new to me i don't know where you work with them before
B :  Um
B :  Then we will come to be ugly
B :  To actual project plan and all know what i hope whole it's about uh idea new
B :  Remote control we're going
B :  Going to design
B :  Uh then we will
B :  Uh discuss uh
B :  Well what should be in uh
B :  What what so what our new product should look like
B :  Like
B :  And uh well then uh offer some twenty five minutes i hope uh okay okay
B :  Sure
B :  Yeah um
B :  Basically this is about the uh in new remote control
B :  Um
B :  We
B :  When you design a new product you off by of course want it to be original be the we want to be distinguished
B :  People
B :  Oh uh
B :  One two uh one a look at the shelf or to think well
B :  That's the product that i need
B :  Oh it needs to be trendy
B :  And trendy is what people want so they know they will buy a product
B :  But then they uh huh
B :  It also should work uh
B :  User-friendly
B :  Uh all the lights people uh uh well
B :  It will not be uh
B :  Be rated very well in consumer our article stuff like that
B :  So the general outline of
B :  Uh
B :  You project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase
B :  Um
B :  You all get um
B :  For the task uh
B :  In these uh in his face and
B :  Uh
B :  Then we will meet again and uh discuss the functional design
B :  And the same
B :  Holes for
B :  The uh
B :  Two faces uh
B :  Offer this the conceptual design
B :  And
B :  Often does have a more detail design
B :  In which the final project should get
B :  Different shape
B :  Alright but first we will do some uh tool training
B :  In all in front of you uh
B :  You see uh they're uh
B :  No it looks and will but not not blocks and we have here a
B :  Okay
B :  He a white board
B :  And um
B :  Well it should work uh i've read it from my uh uh
B :  From from college
B :  It should work with some kind of toolbar it didn't find out yet i would work but
B :  Maybe one of you did so
B :  Um
D :  And the documents in the shared folder
B :  Yes
B :  Do do we have to say something about that i. e. i. e. and not for little bit about this shared folder
D :  Yeah i guess we'd have a shared folder
D :  Uh with the commands that can share
B :  Yes well we will
B :  Then
B :  Find out what how it works
D :  Yes
B :  Um
B :  Well this seems to me us some computer program but i didn't find it yet
B :  So
B :  We'll come to that later
B :  So
B :  Uhuh
B :  Now we will try out the whiteboard we've here
B :  So
B :  Hi
B :  Would suggest uh
D :  It shows
B :  Well yeah so um we uh
B :  If you try to
B :  To draw on it and then
B :  Well it should be smart some way you hate
B :  Not really
B :  Sure how this works but
D :  Okay shall i start
C :  Yeah you can set it you know
B :  Yes that would be uh
A :  I think for us is is like a normal whiteboard
A :  But are we recording
A :  Oh i got them
C :  Now the the court so that there's a sense so that it is going to record the strokes
A :  Mm
A :  But for us it's just like a little while board
B :  Okay
C :  Mm
D :  It's
D :  Actually i think i can go with the
B :  You you
B :  Doesn't it work
B :  Maybe some um and maybe maybe yeah maybe you can start and you can maybe find out
B :  Discourse right
A :  Not to draw
B :  So um
B :  Why don't you draw uh
B :  Your favourite animal on the whiteboard
A :  Right they are animal
A :  First of all time yeah yeah
B :  Oh i see uh
C :  Yeah
B :  So drops we will try to get a lot of these
A :  Either that or or
A :  We
A :  Mm
A :  You know can get a guess from my drawing
A :  Uh better and
A :  But you have all the way
A :  Right
A :  Um plus side
A :  Get set it to animal
A :  Like a cat
C :  Yeah
B :  It's like a cat so i guess it's cat
A :  No i like at that
B :  What
D :  You want a nice
C :  Yeah
C :  Well i think it's fine
C :  And that don't want to put it off
C :  And this will have no
C :  Really the wireless
C :  No
C :  Especially should next what we should take to like that
B :  So
A :  Sorry
B :  That's to get
A :  It's only gets a dog
B :  It's a dark
A :  Yes
B :  So those are that's also kind of
C :  Although not doesn't have a a look
A :  It's got to ellen
B :  But but the others
C :  Yeah
C :  True yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  And that's all about circuit
A :  So the cats
B :  Did you are
A :  That's load up
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah i think it would go we don't
D :  But that it
D :  Right
B :  Okay
C :  You can still a text template it's not top of that
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  So you got characteristics
A :  Oh that was fairly and loan fun
A :  What's
C :  It's the costs
A :  This is what you would the design a
A :  My marketing
B :  Yes yes
B :  Yes definitely or
B :  Yes well very good
B :  So
A :  Ah
B :  It's both
C :  Ah i think you can put that mm

A :  I'm else
B :  It's looks like it
B :  Get was been driven over
A :  Oh i guess
D :  Yeah
D :  And we should sum up it's so it carries characteristics right
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes the most uh
D :  So
B :  That's that that leak that
D :  Yeah
D :  I mean it is
D :  They like to sleep that's where you said you know

B :  Thank thank you miss you
D :  Thank you my dear
A :  He rats or a small
D :  Oh right okay
B :  Yes this this says in uh
B :  Some contribution to our project
D :  And your name
A :  Use it
B :  So uh-huh
D :  Mm
B :  Let's see
B :  With them all
B :  Not being drawn yet
B :  So you fold wrong land that um also one as well
B :  And all the water
D :  Uh the
D :  Okay in the water
A :  Oh right
A :  But not that is
D :  Mm
A :  That had to guess
D :  Yeah
D :  Pretty close maybe to the help
A :  Yeah
B :  Yes
C :  Yeah you use
D :  With different pen widths
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So
A :  But the shock yeah
D :  I to shock yeah
B :  Well we have one or
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Is it a shot to me
A :  Mm
C :  I think that uh
D :  It
C :  Yeah i
D :  Uh
A :  No it's the swordfish
B :  I don't
D :  You have some in a in a straight yeah alright
A :  So it which
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh
D :  I don't know
A :  Maybe
A :  And at the same one uh
B :  Nope still works
D :  For so i don't know if we need to spend time on that actually
D :  Yeah
C :  Oh well
B :  Well this uh
B :  It still seems work
D :  Yeah exactly yeah
B :  That's continue
B :  To uh huh
D :  Well
B :  Um
B :  Our project uh
B :  Fine as uh
B :  I think uh when we are
B :  And when when you are going to design where we must keep in mind that's
B :  Be selling price of the product
B :  Uh will be about twenty five euros all
B :  When
B :  Designing a product uh
B :  I also look at you uh
B :  Well
B :  Keep in mind uh
B :  People up
B :  What to get a feeling this is a twenty five euro project
B :  The programme
D :  The remote control yep for our product
B :  Yes okay
B :  Um
B :  More interesting for our company course but a profit aim
B :  About fifty million euro
B :  So
B :  We have to sell uh
B :  Quite a lot of this uh
B :  Um things
B :  Uh we we will try to uh
B :  To get at the international market uh so will that will do you think maybe
B :  You're up and uh and our um our cat
C :  Or a certain amount or maybe
B :  Maybe some uh asian countries
B :  Um
B :  Also an important role is um
B :  The the product the production cost be a
B :  Next small uh
B :  Twelve uh twelve euro fifty cents
D :  So it's
D :  Hi of of the selling price if i am good in mathematics
B :  Yes of course uh um
B :  I mean we still have to uh to make a process huh
D :  Of course
C :  Yeah to say like this will really in the middle so
B :  You all have to be based
C :  Oh yeah committee had a selected for million to make a little of it
D :  Alright but it it must have to
D :  I
D :  Four million
B :  Tall ah well i think what when we're working on the international market uh
B :  In principle of have an of customers uh so when we have a good product
B :  We are we could to me case this aim i think
B :  So that's about finance
B :  And uh
B :  Now just let's have some discussion about
B :  What is a good remote control
B :  And uh well
B :  Keep in mind is this first points to have to be original to have to be trendy have to be user-friendly
B :  Um
B :  Maybe someone
B :  Can mention some additional
B :  Oh uh prerequisites for a tooth remote control
C :  Of course it should have a on a button
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes well uh it should have p. d. d. d.
B :  Expected functionality uh all all the remote control
C :  Yeah that's and that it depends what application you're using it for you might need uh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  We're we're thinking television uh
C :  We have to have targeting the television set so
C :  You need to a colour cannot
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Do you need to mm
C :  Dolls the
C :  Close it
C :  Channels enough for government great
B :  Yes
B :  Yes that that that's a any i i always makes it an old form remote controls that you can go channel up or down in instead of retyping the number especially when you have a lot channels
C :  Are in there
C :  Yeah
D :  I just be for studying uh detailed discussion maybe we you have the marketing guy uh well uh
A :  I'm marketing
C :  Are are good it's
D :  So it yeah marketing
D :  And you line you you user interface
C :  Yeah
D :  Um design
D :  They just yeah wanted to to be sure uh i'm "'s" a
D :  But then just really designer okay
B :  Yes
D :  Because i i don't know you very aware actually right okay okay
C :  I am at two we have all
D :  I don't mind
C :  But it
D :  Happy to meet you
A :  And uh
D :  Okay is very
C :  And
B :  And i'm number
C :  Oh my i had to yeah well i think you you normally yeah okay yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Just a new web page but uh yeah but uh
B :  So
B :  Um
D :  Face to face
D :  So
B :  Some other very important
B :  Things to to to
B :  Well
B :  That's fine is first face
B :  Soft project
B :  Oh the browse function
B :  As in
C :  And uh
A :  But mm
C :  You'd need the usual ones like the training the one you could mean there
C :  Well uh channel and um
B :  Yeah
C :  You know it could do we have a
C :  Mm
C :  The teletext and all those things tomorrow or you might have a some more functions which right um tool that
A :  Mm
D :  Like what it's like internet on the uh
C :  The uh i. p. or
A :  Mm
C :  Now we are looking for
C :  Television
C :  Things or a p.
C :  For example
C :  But still we did a corner and all the stuff that coming up
A :  Mm
A :  But we carry design "'cause" i'm it hasn't been amended yeah
C :  Well it's it's it's it's coming up back to the the poster video recorder and all those things we did yeah
B :  Well uh i i think
D :  Actually yeah
B :  You know so you should i think i think is over uh with a special uh what
B :  What functionality
D :  Of course and first before um designing the for the wireless think you know what the functionalities that we need to know what are the user requirements and
A :  Yeah
D :  And then you they need internet then would be able to to to propose something with that
D :  Uh a t. v. although i p. but before
A :  Ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time you'll be using the main functions the volume
A :  A different channels so i
A :  We can have a look fancy things as well but the main controls e. d. t. d. i. l. p. isn't very easy to use
B :  Uh-huh and keep keep in mind you to use it at twenty five euro unit
B :  So
B :  Uh it it it does very fancy stuff uh
B :  We we can leave it out i think so twenty five euro you expect eight
A :  Mm
B :  Quite
B :  Well normal but good functioning
B :  User-friendly remote control
C :  All in that case it can be a little top it there
C :  Someone with a weighting that that you know
C :  You will use those that for the customers your product to them you know
A :  Mm
D :  Maybe what we
A :  Which i get to be made
D :  We want to design a new one
C :  Yeah
C :  No it's okay yeah i had the steps so you need some number in but that's um teletext things and then the um
D :  Yeah
D :  But you the main use it draws and
B :  Yes but but but about uh about the spec uh the buttons
B :  The buttons uh that will be on it
B :  I think we can discuss that in in next meeting
C :  Yeah
B :  Uhuh
B :  I would
B :  Like two
B :  Get this wrap up and go to the end of this meeting
C :  Okay
C :  Okay we are under mm
D :  Okay
B :  So you know now the basic
B :  The basic things
C :  Yeah
B :  And
B :  Well just just for the next meeting now um
B :  L. o. uh
B :  You were you have to work on a designed to keep in general i mean
B :  So we'll we will be still select flexible with
B :  Maybe adding some functions
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh um
B :  You will we working on on
B :  Technical function design so
C :  Yeah sure
B :  And uh
B :  You when you add uh uh
B :  Uh well think about requirements uh does it need instead off or do do we stay at
B :  Basic
B :  Basic television uh
B :  Interface
B :  So of uh of you
B :  I think we should know all go work uh uh
B :  At this and uh
B :  You will be informative i email one other kind of complication
C :  The case
B :  So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes in
B :  In mind
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
