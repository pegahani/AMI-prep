A :  Well welcome to be the first meeting
A :  Yeah real reactions uh um development meetings for a new television remote control
A :  That's for those are very successful intrinsically you can see the market so the last
A :  Year will save and which we wanted to build on taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and they
A :  Uh the latest uh
A :  My feelings in in consumer design and uh
A :  And in and and uh
A :  We want to make this the the very best
A :  For that
A :  That's possible for everybody
A :  Uh whatever you want
A :  Yeah that's a good price for the consumer and that's a good price for the company
A :  And then to that end we
A :  Need also work together
A :  Uh to do that um
A :  And it that in a particular older "'cause" but everybody is uh
A :  Just as vital to this projects um i'll just give "'em" that the table and really
A :  Marketing
A :  And you can draw with the uh
A :  And design they be the user interface and in case with the industrial design
A :  Um
A :  What's that they they project is easy to use this to to get this this project of the meeting at everybody uses free to
A :  Uh so you what what are they want
A :  Uh that'd be
A :  As a contribution to make
A :  And uh
A :  Everybody feel free to
A :  Interrupt me to meet on to to say what you want to sign
A :  Um in in terms of the the immediate meeting the uh
A :  And that that that'd be
A :  That would be nice to be also these were the the company for a while but if if if anybody feels that they needed
A :  It's a more back and souls please do if if if if he wants to
A :  But briefly give that that background so that is quite clear what's
A :  Everybody yeah
A :  Uh it is experiences please do so
A :  Uh
A :  That that far but that welcome anybody to uh
A :  So isn't it be fair balanced cells in fact we would do that by pointing and stable quickly and since i mean what what contribution you you looking to make so so i'm andrew
D :  Oh well you sound room or i would uh-huh
D :  Market research
D :  Person for this uh this meeting this uh
D :  Project for creating this you will patrol and uh yeah i'll be yeah
D :  Getting information statistics on what people want to
D :  What's yeah
D :  Get from this new design hope you want to have the like and that a fashion point here and about the company
A :  But you can
C :  I'm can draw and and they do and just user interface designer and um
C :  Haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before that time mm so i won't be
C :  Working on the design
A :  But this means you haven't "'cause" any preconceived ideas so
C :  Right
C :  Yep and this to open to being creative
A :  Yep it
B :  Oh i'm katie can the industrial designer and i'll just be i guess presenting about the printer working somewhere a little remote control and uh uh yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Very very quickly um this at the want to make this meeting to structured "'cause" the the whole idea is that it's uh
A :  Um them i think tank uh resize what about the what they want to say and then we don't want to be constrained by
A :  Uh no convention alright
A :  Uh
A :  Slides on screens all all anything else um
A :  But um
A :  Briefly
A :  Um
A :  This is what we want to do the remote control needs to be original has be something it makes it that's uh
A :  Of the remote controls and half so that
A :  As soon as people say i think a um
A :  Yes that's different
A :  Uh how one one
A :  Um
A :  And
A :  That goes along with being trendy and it yeah they are want it
A :  Uh seen on a user friendly as as we all know
A :  Remote controls combine yeah
A :  Uh very user unfriendly
A :  So we want to make arrows
A :  One that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious
A :  How that works
A :  And and they also
A :  What took the price and think oh yeah
A :  That's something that my may not need know the remote control but
A :  Uh
A :  It's such a nice one gonna have on
A :  And last but not least all indeed first of all
A :  They must make the company money
A :  And we may become a money drawing
A :  Producing what the consumer wants
A :  The yeah
A :  That uh the want to be done is it the um
A :  The functional design
A :  Uh what it's uh
A :  What it was actually do
A :  The the conceptual design
A :  Uh huh we
A :  Actually
A :  Present that's the consumer uh and that that the detailed design it is
A :  Yeah how we get that into production
A :  Yeah yeah they
A :  The the main design so what we have to be able to those are my name's is is the whiteboard
A :  And uh
A :  Yeah
A :  This is very quickly do what it what it says in my
A :  Yeah and and the problem slide yeah
A :  Um
A :  A suggestion how we're gonna be a kind of an cells from the yeah
A :  They're the ones that we didn't do that
A :  Um
A :  Now so that's not acting as well whiteboard a so we'll um
A :  Yeah
A :  We do a virtual drawing on the on the on the whiteboard of you'll you'll and uh
A :  Yeah
A :  Data animal but that's just give and take a ball
A :  Your favourite animal
D :  Yeah but yeah
A :  Why
D :  Yeah
D :  It's nice contrast for the way in there
A :  Uh huh
D :  I feel like the underdog kind of status
D :  And there
A :  Yeah no my my wife's is gonna be able to about as often as a button wants mixing that
D :  I
C :  I
D :  I i
A :  Yeah
A :  In the
C :  Um probably it back i guess i had an like
C :  The way they look and then it is nice animals and and how they can fly or swimmer walk around or whatever
A :  Uh huh
A :  Right okay
B :  Uh courses
B :  No particular reason why
A :  No innovative yeah
B :  Uh-huh
A :  I'm not so i've got a favourite animal to be quite honest i think
A :  Hey mister p. m. because of their their
A :  Yeah it'll ability to uh
A :  Yeah
D :  Make mobile phones and
D :  T. v. remotes
B :  I think
D :  Three t. v. remotes
A :  And a dash so that they yes that that's um
A :  Okay and so what we need to keep in mind here that the uh we won't sell this for for twenty five euro you know um
A :  We want to
A :  Making april profit for the the company a fifty million euro already so we're we're looking at saving a lot of these
A :  Um that the costly in top a nice
A :  And and we're looking at the price profit of fifty percent
A :  A nice cost twelve euros fifty to make
A :  Um
A :  So we're not any looking at a a very trendy original product we're looking at making it
A :  It's a very good price
A :  Um
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  Would it be lights like to switch to start by giving are but um so quickly resolve of current remote controls
C :  Well i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and that it's handy it's when you have one uh works both the
C :  D. v. d. player or whatever and the t. v. as well
C :  Um but that it's easy to see if you can switch back and forth instead of having to
C :  Press a bunch of different buttons and
C :  So i think it is
C :  Best and they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons are supposed to use
C :  No
A :  Any any thoughts about the buttons all
A :  And you all the way of approaching me that the uh the problem
A :  Or any videos strong feelings about remote controls have the the bad ones of use of good ones that used to
A :  Well so that lost and
A :  But if and again
B :  I think it's important you should be able to uh when you when you press the buttons are actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere you should have to like control yourself and twist your remote control to get the t. v. to actually pick up the signal
D :  Yeah
D :  The court and from us to come with t. v. there's an extra t. v.s in t. v. there's maybe aren't
D :  Like in a year that's put all the different to the very boring very plain
D :  I think it's very
D :  Right i can
D :  Making a stylish control would be a very like
D :  Easily there's one step ahead of the competition
A :  And um well well so what what did what particular style features so you think about it
D :  Um
D :  It's on the looks
D :  Which does look like remote control
D :  To somehow looks like uh
D :  So you recycle was this
D :  Like this pen doesn't really like a pen makes you think yeah
D :  So
A :  To me that
D :  So that's the thing
A :  Yeah i don't know i mean do you think is the rest of it doesn't look at remote control there are people when the seasons remote control
A :  Um and uh
D :  Uh-huh suppose
D :  Causes of the marketing to
D :  To make make people aware of the product
A :  No
A :  Any other thoughts right so um
A :  The the physical appearance of uh
A :  Uh remote controls
C :  I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just as big
B :  Mm
C :  Rectangular things and and that kind of awkward hold onto so something that's more comfortable bit sits on a person's hand better
A :  With the the thing that in immediately comes to mind is computer
A :  Mouses
A :  Which um
B :  Mm
C :  Yeah
A :  Maybe all sorts of shapes
A :  In the shops instance um quite
A :  Fancy ones
C :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  And um have some propose experience which
A :  Look nice but uh particularly comfortable
C :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  Many calls of them buttons all flat screens or more
A :  Uh
D :  Well the from the nice idea you could you could have lost a remote as
D :  These plastic with the big rubber buttons cicada that we should press
D :  Residual my spongy it could be all be flats
D :  And the buttons are very can also at all but instead of
D :  Being grey state of the device
D :  You push into device is like a mouse but
A :  Yes
A :  I mean
A :  The thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room or
D :  Has was
A :  Um you need to be able to uh
D :  Easily yeah
A :  Far from the button buttons easily
C :  But maybe they could be concave sort of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could field um
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah so
A :  It's a matter of thing at the same
A :  More more concrete buttons so
A :  So maybe difference
A :  Um
A :  Do we need it to uh
A :  A copy of any other remote controls that are no that's a laptop at all
A :  Do we
C :  Oh yeah
B :  Mm
A :  Do we want so
C :  Like a like a mobile phone
A :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah they
A :  Mm "'kay"
A :  So you can't really have any thoughts it's that that's how we might markets
A :  Something which
A :  They're already
A :  Millions and that and that we want to uh
A :  Uh huh to take over the entire
A :  Um point it's worth
D :  Um
D :  Especially try to sell two million from
D :  Oh sorry four million uh uh
D :  I think that if we market this is not has
D :  No
D :  Well this
D :  "'kay" you care what is the point he would have to pick up a whole market sixties where you got one word appeals to people don't want to
D :  Have they need device it looks cool
D :  It's fashionable
D :  And he just it's a it's a car is one mother wrote a want rather than a kind of a neat which is with
A :  Uh-huh
D :  But that might for kids and actual device four buttons nations and you may not like respond to
D :  Having a device that they just looks nice if we want so we could practical
D :  Same time
D :  I guess
D :  This grass appeal to people that wants
D :  Device that
D :  Can i answer living room
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And also a device that
D :  Yeah
D :  As
D :  That's the sense
D :  So um but some of the side which which i'm gonna button or both
A :  Okay yeah yeah well what
D :  Emission
A :  I think in any uh any prices that we identify we we we need to aim for for all off
A :  Um
A :  Okay but so souls or um um
A :  The the industrial design so uh
B :  Oh i think it's it's a remote controls it has a unique idea "'cause" it's you depend on them so much but you don't
B :  It it's
B :  These are sooner which are working on think of them as a car but a computer can break down you can like go off and off the voice complex things going on timit sons we get massive actually it they they just need to be very very dependable because people
B :  So taken for granted and then is your remote control breaks it's it's
B :  Godspeed you get to get up and mainly change the channel
C :  Hmm
B :  No it it just it needs to be very effective a
A :  And indeed
B :  Always dependable
B :  Uh i don't think we should make it too small "'cause" i think it needs to it it can be too big like you're saying beginning huge and on a cord but also uh if you make it too small car like a mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um this is the end up on our couch cushion somewhere
B :  Um
B :  Yeah
B :  That's that's dependable and have uh said that the average size
A :  Okay
A :  And um close
A :  Materials
A :  Kendra a new
C :  Well um
C :  Most i think most of the remote controls now retired it's black or grey is a member should go with something different are be able to
A :  Yeah
C :  I was just thinking of how um but they're gammas mobile phones now how you can get bit different
C :  Um but like uh like the face plates that you change so we could have maybe i don't know for would be feasible to do something like that
A :  Right yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Mm
C :  We can change the
C :  Face plates or have kind of of arabia so people can get different
A :  Okay
C :  Different things
C :  Have a kind of look how they want to go
C :  Different colours
C :  Things like that
A :  Right
C :  Probably just plastic because that's our spotlight yes
A :  Yeah
A :  It carries out so
A :  Again i don't think that's ever been done before words uh
A :  Sort of it
A :  So it's sort of thing that we get people
A :  Uh thinking yes that's something that are haven't gotten uh
A :  Might need to enter any thoughts on it so
A :  How much
A :  Mark it's
A :  Interchangeable
A :  From some on the remote control
D :  Um we could do the markets together
D :  You by your control in
D :  Said colour or
D :  We have
D :  What you buy it with
D :  Several
D :  Uh uh like
D :  You get you you get the
D :  At the face plates with it when you buy or a separate thing
D :  Yeah
D :  And maybe thinking that it's
D :  "'cause" uh the nature of the device maybe
D :  Second thing wait a second can pick the market
B :  Uh-huh
D :  You facials for your
D :  Do you might
D :  Cool but this tree
D :  Since it's a kind of thing where you can only get one and then for guess but
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Or switch on or
B :  We could probably novelty ones like the time about the mobile phones you get like different you know scenes from movies and stuff on the remote control
A :  I think
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah
D :  How as well as uh as yeah yeah
B :  And sorta
B :  Stagger the release of them and get people a pack cover on it now and not keep them spending money
C :  Yeah
A :  Right okay i think we've got some
D :  Yeah sure
A :  A good idea in a row we uh meeting is uh
A :  You speak uh wraps up very quickly sorry where
A :  Um
A :  We got
A :  Thirty minutes to
A :  Start looking at the um
A :  For the design more detail
A :  Um
A :  Um well we will we can do in in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh
A :  Mm more formal lost
A :  Yeah thank you very much indeed
