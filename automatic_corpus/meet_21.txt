C :  Okay
B :  Yeah
B :  Hmmm paul
B :  Training yes
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So but
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  Let's talk about money
A :  Uh well going to
A :  To send we want to set of a cease remote control for twenty five euro euro
A :  And um
A :  Oh oh expected profits will be around fifty million euro
A :  And uh
A :  Well trained to
A :  To have a market or around the world
A :  So we're not used and not only for switch on and that's for two
A :  Uh
A :  So um
A :  Is that
A :  We expect the production cost of
A :  Maxim um
A :  Uh uh twelve point fifty euro
B :  Per unit i guess
A :  Yeah of course
B :  Yeah okay
A :  Um
A :  We can start today twelve first idea of what we want to do what top
A :  Our experiments with remote control and
A :  Any idea
A :  So
A :  If you have
A :  Some experiments go do but with remote controls you can share it and
A :  Say what
A :  Well that's why do you know
A :  Anything
D :  Well from experience um
D :  I've had a remote controls in the past so that had very
D :  I've had lots and lots of buttons and i've been very small has been very had to
D :  To to use because there's so many buttons
D :  And you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what's and the buttons are very small and very hard to press
D :  Um and minimally you any of the use you know on a t. v. remote you i need to use
D :  Mostly
D :  You know if for of six buttons
D :  Um
D :  So it's frustrated me in the past
B :  Okay i i have all some points um maybe two points of first would be there in current the remote control there's no like lights
B :  So if you're if you're saying that they use in the dark room it's it's probably worse too too
B :  Have something like oh
B :  The clyde then maybe
B :  It could be also depending on the the amount of of flights in the room so that if if it's in the day it does need to be the quite it's because it works in about three so
B :  So something like these and the second thing
B :  Second point for me it would be
B :  That in the normal remote controls there is uh they are two buttons for volume control but i prefer like a petition leader or something like
D :  Ah okay
B :  You know some slide here
A :  Okay
B :  Or not just to discrete buttons for volume but something which
D :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Is that because the
D :  Of the discrete
D :  Volume levels where is that
B :  Yeah but i can reach it in the once again i can mutate down or or make a
A :  That's all you're not afraid that
B :  Hi volume
A :  If you take your remote control you can move the slide and you can
A :  Them is the the volume can work very
B :  I'll
B :  Mm
A :  Quickly and
B :  If it drops to the floor then it starts the screen
A :  Yeah i was if you when you take to the remote control for example on the table
A :  You take it and you push the button and it's everything this data and then
A :  You're right
B :  Yeah oh
B :  Oh it depends but would you feel about that
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah we can we can
B :  Think of these things have to was but if um outdoor you have some more knowledge than that
C :  Uh yeah
A :  So you can do that
C :  Yeah you just the same colour the experience
C :  I i i prefer um remote control boarding be the radio waves because remote control a boarding be the infrared surveys you should
A :  That's true
C :  You should you should keep eating a specific connection and then try it hard to you
A :  We sell tops the colours that
A :  Okay
A :  Has continually have a meeting and five minutes so
D :  Okay
A :  Maybe we should have a
B :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  We will close uh this meeting
A :  So we we live for the next meeting in uh thirty minutes
A :  Um
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm d. and so i will ask you to do some more uh and to um
A :  The interface interface developer will walk and uh and the design also uh remote controller stop tool
A :  It was a new i. d. and
B :  The chip which is how much
A :  We don't uh
B :  Okay
D :  Is the industrial designer really industrial designer
B :  Uh um the technical design and in which well
D :  Yeah i think that's the first
A :  And you see an hour
D :  I. d.
D :  Industrial designer
D :  And the second one is the user interface designer
B :  Yeah okay

A :  So we can try
C :  Okay
A :  And for was uh marketing uh
A :  Hmmm manager
A :  Which is but uh
A :  You are going to try to
A :  To find the user
A :  Week or a man's for uh for a remote control
A :  Um
A :  You would we see if by you made
A :  Uh it is uh
A :  Specific instructions and uh
A :  By your personal coach
A :  So i see you in thirty minutes
D :  Great okay
