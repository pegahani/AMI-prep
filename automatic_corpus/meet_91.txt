A :  Is
A :  Or not say that it's
D :  Uh yeah i have to
D :  Open up from elsewhere
B :  Or
A :  Already exist you want to places as i am
A :  Hmm
A :  Nice to try to transfer it to my documents but
D :  Yeah you have to have to close that window "'cause" that's the save one is right so
D :  And then find it
A :  Yeah to a spreadsheet
A :  Yeah but have to write on the street to see easiest way
A :  Okay uh
A :  Uh
A :  Mm
C :  All of a uh prototype the t. v.
C :  Number
C :  Could look up
D :  A second level
A :  Uh
C :  You know it's it's like a a front side
D :  Uh-huh yes
C :  Um it's almost curved
C :  Like option i mean display as well
A :  Uh
C :  Um the line at the bottom indicates that there is the power a light pole down
C :  And the extra function buttons
A :  Hmm
C :  A blue one up at all
D :  Uh-huh
C :  On the line
C :  All about the stick on button with the company will want
B :  Yes i have a a false last cherry design at the top
B :  How to stop like that
D :  So it is yeah tell you if you're actually yeah
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Well for that that that can only it's a kind of
C :  You think apply think computers like a mark
B :  Yeah yeah we might get the
D :  Copyright there was this this one
C :  Yeah jerry stuff on summary
D :  What's on there
C :  I that's the me
D :  Okay
B :  The m.
C :  M. i.
C :  It would have to be able to meet
C :  But um we'll have anything small enough true
B :  Yeah i thinking
D :  Okay
B :  For the price um well those hard to get the hand the actual labelling on the
B :  Individual but
C :  Yeah
C :  I would just use simple shapes fall them um
C :  The important ones are the volume wants to make them a bit better
C :  Then you could possibly be a bit smaller
B :  Um they're separate off think l. uh the volume related passes from the channel or less buttons you got the volume in orange on design uh and uh the channels and they
C :  Hmm
A :  Right right and all these things of cost implications
C :  Yeah we chose have a plus the design that's
A :  And so what i've done my thing on the cost of that
A :  Eh i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh
A :  The red apple but
A :  So
A :  However i've no well i to do that but um i guess it better would be a cost implication on that and uh
A :  I suppose that as to whether we wanted to put in all these colours would be uh
A :  Well and to to be i suppose
C :  Well "'cause" one
C :  That's
C :  The wouldn't be too important to put in have any likely to
A :  I have an important consideration i
C :  So the colour buttons came from
A :  Right okay so um
A :  And the second one underneath would be the idea for the uh
B :  Some of the slide away
A :  Right okay
A :  So we've got to um detailed design meeting
A :  Right
A :  So mm
A :  So we've got to
A :  Prototype presentation we should just done
A :  Evaluation criteria
A :  Um
A :  And finance so
A :  I guess we have to evaluate that meets
A :  The thing is uh aspects that we're looking for
A :  Uh from um our previous meeting
A :  So other than the fact that it doesn't have the same they are
A :  But
A :  And modesty
A :  Obviously we i think that um that are other it out what the buttons the only thing that has really changed
A :  Is the
A :  Is the colouration of the buttons
B :  Yes yes
A :  And so
A :  But but after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance
A :  And yeah
A :  And the cost of the kitchen a missionary right this is the "'kay"
A :  It because there's probably kind of important so um and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture
A :  Um
A :  But that would be uh
D :  So he adds to a presentation now
D :  We just like on the prototype
B :  This this is uh yes the presentation of the prototype
D :  That's right
D :  Okay
A :  Right so uh as far as the the finances that we can say we can make sure that the cost by the production cost "'cause" you may remember that was one the first uh consideration has to be and under and
A :  Yeah twelve fifty or two and a half at twelve and a half euros
A :  So there's no redesign
A :  So it should uh huh
A :  Right so
A :  Seems to me that the thing that i have to do it is
A :  Is what we find that to
B :  Quick as an apologist we can see
B :  Do you mean java think it's uh
A :  Uh huh
D :  Ish again
A :  Right
D :  Okay and uh
A :  O. k.
D :  We could do is you'd call on the production costs look at the prototype
A :  Right
A :  Oh
B :  That should be there
A :  Okay so by the fact that we've got to uh-huh
A :  Simple chip
A :  And the uh kinetic energy source
A :  We've got a single curved mm
A :  Case
A :  We've got to uh
A :  Rubber mm
A :  Uhuh
A :  Case materials supplements so we have decided that we're having rubber buttons and
B :  Have a push button interface
A :  Okay yeah
A :  What the button supplements well originally i thought it would just be
B :  Um
A :  That one in there because it was the one raid mm apple but
B :  Um
A :  So the so that we'll
A :  Oh oh the real question then we come in
A :  Do you make all the buttons uh-huh
D :  Well what to do on the prototype so
D :  Somewhat yes
A :  Well
A :  So we've got one special button form which was the apple everything else is gonna be a standard
B :  And then we can
A :  With a special material rubber wood titanium extension that so i was
A :  Or is are saying about rubber wasn't special but according to this maybe it is
A :  So
B :  Oh well
A :  And the room and innovative and we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on their uh-huh
D :  Yeah i think just to
D :  Wonder you for the
A :  Uh well
A :  I don't know if this is the sole answer is that meant to be all sixteen buttons and therefore
A :  And it was you know the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons
A :  But just to have the one that was
A :  Soft and spongy and therefore
D :  I think i think it's just it's just a one else
A :  Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber wears the rest would be hard plastic
D :  Yeah i think that in the button supplements is just a supplement for all the buttons be made in a different material
D :  Well some uh button
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I don't know
A :  And i would do that
A :  Every design change it is it
A :  I don't know um the right
A :  Okay um
A :  If we just had all the buttons a standard
A :  Except for the one that appleton that would take care of that i case
A :  We do one special colour um want visual button form
A :  And wayne
A :  I i plug that in last time
A :  Yes i remember it has to be under twelve and a half
A :  As far as i know that to um
A :  That took care of the uh
A :  Of the thing is supplements
A :  And if
A :  Or um
D :  You just come up the window and another one is on the palmer
C :  Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box yeah
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah right i think if okay so but the point would be that if we uh
A :  If we just a special oh sorry you were saying that
A :  It would be that one that you would put in one there
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
B :  So as nine point one that's we've got some
A :  So it wasn't it's it's nice nine point seven i've got
A :  Okay
B :  It's "'cause" there
A :  So that would
A :  That would work i'm fine if uh
A :  Uh that's assuming you're correction or are we
A :  Assuming that that one change covers all the buttons and that would be fine
A :  And there's nothing else as far as i can see that we we uh the plan to put one or
B :  This is which is switching on there is um on the electronics we got the sample sensor them uh which is got a simple chip
B :  Which costs want
B :  Um i guess the sample sensor sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing
A :  Ah
D :  Yeah
B :  Which puts up to fall
B :  Should be slightly of our budget of together something else that the cellular standard
B :  Maybe get a one the special form buttons on we could have
A :  Well well um if we
A :  Okay that uses twelve point seven
B :  Syria maybe if we go
B :  Rid of like the maybe one of the special colours
B :  Candles same colour then we could have the voice
B :  Recognition
A :  But remember the the idea was to keep the colour of the uh compare our say so just take uh the special colour for the apple and
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  And when uh
B :  Um
C :  When you have to keep it simple chip there as well you know like and that one to zero
C :  When the chip
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And uh
D :  Yeah i have to have it
C :  Sample speaker be separate things you need both of them
B :  Ah possibly yeah yeah maybe
D :  Yeah
B :  Maybe i'm would be giving a click and i think
A :  Mm
B :  Um
A :  I'll go for battery instead that we give you one less
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah that was save us one that was to be slightly
A :  Do you reckon that i mean the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and
A :  No have to replace batteries mm
B :  Yeah yeah
B :  Was this is the for the whole technology type thing um
B :  You're saying in the market as there's people like kind of interesting gadgets and
B :  Um whether they would figure the the this so the sample sensor and sample speaker
B :  Voice recognition be so overweight well things have
B :  And stuff but she's or whether they would prefer not to you i mean the the paul was but she's running out
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um using the
B :  Um
D :  Yeah
B :  These numbers to go with this i wish are there is a small one so
A :  Which do you think of which do we think
A :  Is the more important as the options
C :  I think the voice rec
A :  In a sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce the number one point two
A :  At least remember that was a minimum requirement the other option if we're planning i'm just going for something chip and cheerful
A :  Would be to um make it uh then direction that we're gonna make a simple
D :  Shall we should reevaluate
A :  Product
D :  The prototype as we've got it now first
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And then to make decisions about what needs to be changed
A :  Uh-huh mm hm
D :  Right um
D :  Have a little thing
D :  So
D :  Look on that one
D :  It's thirteen point seven is now with everything we want on
A :  Mm
A :  It's a region um a backup uh
D :  Yeah just said that
D :  Presentation
A :  Right
D :  Do
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Okay i think at the
C :  Um voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that score
C :  No battery
A :  Okay but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that could find the remote with the got lost
D :  Right okay um
D :  This is about the evaluation criteria be used for that the prototype we've got here
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And so the method is the design team mates prototype
D :  Um evaluate the prototype against
D :  Some criteria that we formulated
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And i was on the gonna be in response to sort of market research
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And also fine um so i guess
D :  And it on a scale from so it should be a one
D :  False paying seven so if it's not a channel files
D :  And that's for
D :  So
D :  I've got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as well
D :  Yeah and
D :  Um so
D :  We have to say with this true or false the the product looks and feels fancy
D :  Um
D :  But the the product demonstrates technical innovation
D :  That is easy to use
D :  Whether it's incorporate in sort of the fashion elements try to buy a
D :  And whether it's sort of recognisable real reaction product
D :  And i have to go for the whiteboard and it's partly sure
D :  Okay
D :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  Right so the first one is um
D :  Just a product look and feel fancy
D :  So if you do this one
D :  Uh
D :  So
B :  Okay well we have uh a single k. f. which was
B :  And maybe like the
B :  Feel the plot is quite good
B :  So uh
D :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  And we have the rubber kinda spongy feel
D :  Yeah
B :  In the time
D :  Yeah yeah
B :  Um
B :  Say that because the fancy
C :  Yeah maybe give it a
C :  Two
D :  But in what is one false a respond to uh forgot
C :  One's true
D :  One's true and okay seven's false
C :  Uh for speech well
D :  First initial okay
D :  So
B :  So yeah so you were maybe two
C :  Yeah "'cause" we haven't got a double curve so how like
A :  Go for one yeah
C :  True true
C :  But it close we've got almost everything we can
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  On the knee socks more space
D :  It's a false is seven
D :  True is one
D :  So it's a part two
D :  Fancy
C :  Yeah
D :  Think okay
A :  Yeah we don't know maybe in it or three
D :  Okay well what to do have it at the end of don't know
A :  Two three
D :  Um
A :  Well i was is that they're censoring all remember that when you look then we've got solar power would not have these are things you could have
D :  Yeah
A :  And we're not going for these option
D :  This this is just this is just for like the lock does is to to look fancy rather than functional so
C :  Yeah i suppose that might be in the technical innovation yeah
D :  Yeah so that
D :  So used to we go for it
D :  A two on that
A :  Okay
D :  And
D :  I mean how much as a product demonstrate technical innovation
B :  Um as as we deciding between the kinetic
D :  Sure
B :  How at all um
B :  The speech recognition if we had eve of those for our budget the per share
B :  Reasonable to of speech recognition
D :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  So for about a prototype as it is
B :  Um
D :  We've got we've got but
D :  Speech recognition on it that way
B :  But not the kind i think
D :  But not like kinetic
B :  Power
A :  No "'cause" you can afford that would which are that are too or
B :  Oh yeah oh colourful five
D :  Alright so
A :  Can you are
D :  So it doesn't
D :  It's pretty
D :  The press f. as it is isn't sort of
D :  Um
D :  Fulfilling be
B :  Them is may about mutual "'cause" it is "'cause" something but it hasn't got
C :  Maybe three
D :  Okay
A :  Alright and thirteen point seven we do have kinetic the problem is we have to get used them from there
A :  To get it going to twelve point five and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic so
A :  Very much dependent on what you do with your
A :  Options
D :  Okay
A :  And if you definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker
A :  Line because i think the other of functions with calling
A :  Are are more at it
A :  Special material the rubber wood titanium makes it true
A :  If you go for that that that's the the high end "'cause" that's point six west and it to adjust special colours to this point two
A :  Yeah trying to lose one point two
A :  So it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensor is
A :  Speaker
A :  You're basically than having to go for the cheaper options and everything else
A :  And and the simple we could do it would be to have the battery
A :  To have your
A :  Uh sample sensor speaker
A :  And then you're looking to the t. can't
A :  That point two
D :  It's gonna check the email
A :  Which would be come from the button supplements category
D :  And sketch a exactly where it said
D :  In the email for um
C :  How much of a difference will it make it for me the case and plastic
C :  Because we did say that would we wanna follow the fashion too much
C :  Buttons or or uh
C :  That might be spongy enough and then it might stand the test time that uh
A :  And interface to it but um
A :  Well plastic or rather than rubber
D :  Okay i i
A :  That that that would make the senate if you could either
A :  You could have it if you have that in plastic rather than rubber than that would to enable you to get
A :  You could keep a kinetic thing
A :  You could
A :  Keep your sample sensor you but looking to take the point two
A :  So you could do have to do that then you have special form at the bottom line a special colour at the bottom
C :  Yeah
A :  And that way we need to to do it
D :  Okay
B :  So so is that we make a slightly more fancy
B :  Then we these points innovation if you make it more in in the in the in the two of them win these points of the being fancy so
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  That's that that straight the email i can easily says
D :  It's evaluate the design sort of as it is i think so
D :  I think we need to think about
D :  Finance a three sort of evaluate it
D :  That design
D :  I don't wanna return or or draw something or
A :  Well okay but
A :  It's
C :  Well suppose it through a as a is it yeah
A :  It's rubber as it is yes
D :  So
D :  I mean this is need to go a little bit something because
D :  We've got both three
D :  Oh i see um
A :  Well we've we've got thirteen point seven um we've got at the moment and if and basically we're going to do stand from that but the current one you'd say you would be fancy would be too
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah um for for innovation so
D :  We've got the speech the speech thing and
A :  Uh-huh
A :  I would i said about it too as well
D :  And the two
C :  Yeah two or three
C :  You have to
D :  Okay
A :  Oh
D :  And the next one is south to get it back oh no
A :  Uh-huh
A :  An extra well i can just saying about
A :  Easy to use i would say yes i would go for a one on that just pointing uh-huh
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah i'd say so as well
A :  And incorporate elements of fashion
A :  To attract by our well
B :  Um
A :  Yes and it has some
C :  Yeah it's got the cherry and uh sponginess
A :  Uh
B :  It does yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  And
A :  Yep
D :  So about three maybe
A :  No no
B :  Yeah um hum
C :  Maybe too
B :  Yeah resist in a car well and i think we can actually so these are the moment as it stands system
A :  Yep
A :  Yeah i would say two would seem reasonable
D :  "'s" too
A :  But those are recognisable real
A :  Or uh
D :  Yeah this is
A :  Reaction product
B :  As as as as using all of its all this product was is buttons as got
A :  Uh huh
B :  Try to be label on the bottom saying
C :  Yeah that's a bit more fun than that
D :  Yeah
B :  Where it comes from
D :  So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new
D :  Sort of sleek technology or something as well as having the logo on a lot sensitive
D :  Is it sort of a recogniser product is if it in or are there other products which uh a sort of coffee makers and spacecraft
A :  Uh
A :  Oh uh-huh mm hm
D :  Okay
C :  And what's got the same am speech
C :  Feature as the coffee machine
B :  As a risk of the spongy rubbery this is maybe a bit more kind a comfortable win can sleek and
B :  New age
D :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  It has a tree like that
A :  Okay
A :  So we're going for it
B :  Maybe a kind of three
A :  Two
A :  So three
D :  Two or three
C :  Yeah two or three well
C :  The local would be more um
C :  Recognisable on the actual thing is just a pen would really write on a paper
A :  Sure
C :  But um
D :  Yeah
C :  I think the local would definitely be recognisable and it does have
C :  Actually some of the product too
A :  Mm
C :  To fight
C :  Go for it
A :  Right okay
D :  Two or three
A :  Oh
A :  To write want i said the side
D :  Two okay
A :  Right so
D :  Right
A :  So when i want to change it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements
A :  And then
D :  Yeah
C :  What is what all the numbers me and then you add them up and we sell sorry yeah
D :  Yeah we see i think we sort of
D :  At them up so so that an average is gonna be honest with this uh my head
A :  Back to
A :  True
D :  One point eight or something
D :  I think anyway
D :  So yeah pretty close to two
B :  Yeah so it's
D :  So there is pretty good at the moment but it's gonna get worse is not a week ago
A :  Yep
D :  Try make sure it doesn't get
B :  So you should yeah
A :  True true true but uh huh
B :  So we we get that that was it fifteen point seven was that the price was features we set it has
A :  Yes
D :  Yep
B :  Okay so
B :  We need to
A :  Well you can lose one point two
A :  And still me too
D :  John uh
A :  The requirements
D :  Like india so you get out there
A :  Okay i put it back from
D :  Fine that's
B :  I guess is this is all uh stations is uh the finances but
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
D :  I'm not sure
A :  Cool
C :  Oh probably have to really it
A :  Yes i would've thought so
B :  Yeah yeah well maybe just press and then
A :  Uh-huh
B :  See how race yeah
A :  O. k. cyril was a control yeah if a person
C :  Oh it's um
D :  I say it's quality
A :  Well well how can i had right okay so you can see there that v.
A :  If you want to keep kinetic right you've got a choice the logo and and the battery we could see if you want
A :  You've got to
A :  The sample sensor and sample speaker which is your big item
A :  Oh
B :  Why should we just have a plastic case so we we used to you
A :  That's right
B :  The switch guesses
B :  Um
A :  Which case you
B :  It but within the budget range
A :  Yes
C :  Yeah that be fine "'cause" i was just to try and do we do have for the buttons anyway
B :  So it's eleven point seven and then we could make sure we can if you had all the button supplements
D :  Yeah
D :  Different different colours yeah yeah autoseek that because
A :  Alright
D :  Maybe
D :  Maybe it's a rubber case a bit
D :  Less instead of the corporate identity
D :  Then the sort of in a sleek uh plastic case
B :  Ah so yeah
B :  Um
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay so uh-huh
B :  Uh now lots of all the time the combinations with least a little bit on the
B :  Maybe kind of
A :  Sort of a plastic yes
D :  These little bit on the fashion yeah but
A :  Yep
D :  And then
B :  I have now and then we yeah that's that's within the budget
B :  Um
B :  Do we i should have
B :  We just have one special
B :  Uh the only special forms down here
A :  Well we were uh that was the biggest are you would count them
B :  Um
A :  You got a special colour was actually i was assuming we had the red apple and therefore that was the special colour
C :  Yeah i think we should just a module like buttons
B :  And we we've got we've got the from the other
D :  Yeah
B :  Because all pointing left to go on the phone
A :  Well we've got special form know that be one button and the question was was up all buttons or is that just one button "'cause" our plan really was to have one button on a with a special
B :  Yeah um
A :  So so no matter how you look at that that would be the same the other thing that can be special material rubber wood titanium
B :  I think maybe the special colour we've
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Three not just because um
D :  Yeah
B :  Does the volume and stephan i guess we'd have it was a sharply the moment we just be the star
A :  Alright so special colour you want three and a uh-huh
B :  Yeah which i think we should be uh so we find that
B :  The price
A :  Okay
D :  I say it to you you just need to fit special colour "'cause" it's just to supplement show one
D :  Original colour and then to to supplements
D :  I think maybe
A :  That makes sense
B :  Okay ah that's probably it
D :  Okay
D :  So anyway i need to for that
A :  Okay
D :  "'cause" i mean these these a mold it
D :  The one colour scream older of a piece of part of rubber isn't it
A :  Okay yeah i'd agree with that i think
A :  So special colours too
A :  Oh god special form
A :  Yeah
A :  Is the one on all the rest are all standard a little what you could argue that should maybe week
A :  You were making these buttons then the bottom i was presuming better than the other ones are worried was that the idea
C :  Yeah the volume ones should stand out yeah
B :  Maybe that be a second supplements
D :  Yeah that
B :  Then there's this by a second special form
A :  Ah i would've thought that's probably a power
B :  Are you going
A :  Uh
A :  Why i will
A :  Mm yes mm
A :  Uh
D :  Okay so
B :  Sinuses the be okay
B :  That's twelve point three so still
A :  Right
B :  Where's them but on the
A :  Yep hmmm that makes sense uh-huh
B :  Shall we say we've also the on the fashion in los a bit on the fancy kind of
A :  It's
A :  Yep uh-huh
B :  Senator but generally speaking the cat the other at speeds to the
A :  Our s. s. r. us a baby put fashion for uh uh fashion at three rather than
B :  This is the
D :  So should we do yeah
A :  Two
D :  Well um
B :  As is it i think if it's the
B :  The real problem
B :  Was the
B :  Was company them
C :  Real reaction
A :  Real reaction product i'm not quite sure what is ahead
B :  May is so seems that's that's a that's a that's a that's a new age kind of
A :  Uh-huh
B :  In is innovative
D :  Yeah so
B :  Type company that um having the kinetic feature in the voice recognition
A :  Yep out
B :  Quite high up
D :  So it's if if if we've put in for another special form on important
A :  I was
D :  Then maybe they could be
D :  A different shape
D :  But we got a cherry one
D :  Maybe of the ones could be
D :  Something else shaped
D :  I don't know
D :  No because see this is it's cheaper to make them a different
A :  You mean of
D :  It's as you got you know we've made it
D :  Special form so
D :  And that would sort of maybe keep was
D :  Close on the side of the fashion time or
D :  And it sort of
D :  No keep it quite fancy as well i don't know
A :  When you could are you might get once a year you would change
A :  Because uh the moment you're making a red apple
B :  Yeah so it's a stress
A :  So next year you could make mixtures
A :  Model the same but as a uh-huh
D :  Yeah
B :  But i have a fruit was in fashion next
A :  Uh yeah whatever whatever a lemon yellow a lemon lemon or something on that uh-huh
D :  I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something like a
A :  No
D :  Okay
D :  So we've all three of you got rudolph we got rid off
D :  The plastic
A :  Yeah with the main thing would change really is the casing isn't it yeah
D :  The rubber
B :  Post poll i think we save quite a bit to just go the push button interface which is by far the cheapest
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  So maybe this has not having a name you
B :  Los um
B :  Maybe law something on the innovation side
B :  Yeah
B :  And desires are the most on this
B :  Hi for passing
D :  So we we've got we've got rid of the rubber case paul
D :  We've now it's a bit uh sort of got an extra form an extra colour for the buttons
D :  So maybe in terms of of
D :  Fanciness and fashion ability we're pretty much the same
D :  Maybe so
D :  We could maybe put to it and on them
B :  Anything else is taking less the same so
A :  Well he's a sorry state
B :  Yep is there anything this special forms makes it slightly easier to
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  To use
D :  And what about the sort of innovation
B :  Um oh we still got the kinetic energy
B :  Um
D :  Okay
A :  And speech which are
B :  Yeah the speech feature
D :  And then
D :  Corporate identity
B :  I think we've kind of suppose i would maybe lost
B :  As that it's hot still have the rubber
B :  Rubber case
A :  I would play a route uh-huh all uh-huh
D :  Yeah whether whether that's considered to be set of
D :  Part of the corporate identity i don't know
A :  Mm
D :  Yes maybe not in
B :  I think more the the features of the actual control would be more point maybe than the
D :  Yeah
B :  That's less i think
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Be the way i think it made a fairly close to what
D :  Yeah okay but i mean
C :  Yeah i don't see how could make it any more
C :  Um apart from maybe
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Do the whole thing in that kinda like she of blue like the case and
A :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
C :  But i walk a lot which made a list
A :  Uh-huh
B :  "'cause" that's the the the company logo it's maybe is like i said design which we
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Well but you've got the company logo on there which would say it would be a stick on that yeah so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo and then you but you've got the space for it
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  To stick it on
D :  You know what what's the company colour did you get all that the company colour as well
B :  Uh it's okay sure we've to establish that
C :  No i just
A :  I don't think so but but it but in the sense that as you saw with um the windows although back to it doesn't really matter but virtually in the way that you frame you know the windows
C :  A little go off
A :  Badger own there
A :  It was really doesn't matter what
A :  Colour race is as long as our company's logo
A :  Is frame do in the same way is that what they like uh black i would like that they've got black and white or black and silver
A :  So basically even if you had a a silver uh-huh the same colour of silver on your display because you've got effectively a double a. g. n. on the uh on the little book
A :  Yeah means that it splits off what you're always from the from the product uh-huh
A :  That's actually quite it's easy way of doing it
D :  "'cause" it "'cause" it if we've got point to to play with you really want to
A :  You could put in another
D :  Another colour or would that be
A :  Well in this one you've actually got three colours of buttons
D :  Yeah
A :  Well we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour
D :  Okay
A :  So you were talking about to them with assuming
A :  But all the buttons on the second panel uh-huh the hidden away well
A :  Would all be standard
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  Which
A :  Mm may or may not be the case
D :  Yeah sure save point two for profitability yeah
B :  Um
A :  Well yeah but but but that was uh it was an r. r. button you're thinking of on the other uh-huh on the other option it on the second page is it where
A :  That say you were thinking of maybe having is a different colour
C :  Um i don't think that would really need to be i think if they would just all
C :  Small amount blue buttons it be fine
A :  Oh
B :  Yeah maybe if we
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Needs to be the end up on the market just be the same as well
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Maybe for the the one the gonna see all the time we make a look at and um
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm
B :  Fit the kind of idea for the ones
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And that's the more functional buttons with a worry too much buttons have that is like a pauses in the way anyway you know "'cause" you stop
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah but it's still think that
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I mean you wanna pick up the control and just important
A :  Yeah well mm
D :  Quickly to change channel or volume so
D :  If it's that obvious that's fine if you're mean the panel any look in in each unit
A :  Mm
D :  Then you pay a bit more attention so maybe sort of
D :  Different colour buttons isn't so important
A :  Alright okay
D :  "'cause" yeah
A :  So we just add that to profitability in effect mm
D :  So
D :  Yeah i mean so it
A :  Yes the room uh-huh
D :  Cut the cost
A :  Right so we're meant to finish up in five minutes uh-huh
D :  Same sort of function yeah
D :  Quite a sight
A :  Uh-huh
D :  It's made lot of money
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I
A :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Sure or maybe liz a point on fashion or two three
C :  "'cause" we've lost overall spongy feel
C :  "'cause" it doesn't seem right but it just hasn't changed all
A :  A little bit uh-huh
D :  Oh but i think we said there
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Because you got rid of the rubber we put an extra next to see if we can
D :  Um shape or one of the buttons
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Well a lemon shape
C :  Ah right do we decide about one switch button it was
D :  Well we could have a lemon shape ones for the volume of those
C :  The volume ones
A :  Oh i have
C :  Hi
B :  Yeah i'd like to have that's good
D :  Oh so uh huh
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah i mean i'm sure
D :  Did you have to have a rubber case itself or rubber buttons or was it that way around
B :  You had a robust can work
D :  Right
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So i think we can work
A :  So what okay this way around
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  So uh so you saved
A :  Tell the design team comes and says get out of that you're uh the design thing
B :  No we say it's fine
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Fifty euros on that
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh
A :  So what better way around true uh-huh
C :  Um can i just
C :  Check if that's a cherry or apple do we decide against the apple because a lot of work and do we make a cherry officially
A :  Yeah
A :  I thought that
C :  Right
A :  Oh right okay
B :  Just in case we knew that point two four little seeds
A :  I uh huh
B :  It's a slide
A :  Mm
A :  Mm to that sort of start of a
A :  Mm mm
A :  Hmm
A :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So well we aim at first and talk on that skill
D :  Well we're aiming for um
A :  Yeah
D :  One from them
A :  Yeah
D :  Hmm but it it it has to fit into the project so
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I guess we just have to adjust things to
D :  Get it in there
D :  Just fair enough
B :  I was instead of a man be something in each criteria
B :  We have an to be left anything out so
D :  Yeah i think
A :  Uh-huh
B :  As they have a party which has to be quite cheap it's just a
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So do have anything else to discuss
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I don't know what's on the agenda
A :  Mm
A :  Okay
A :  Uh so okay
A :  Right okay um
A :  Mm
A :  Right okay um
A :  So the right so we've got
B :  Oh really
A :  So we've done the
A :  The finance but an excel president but on the redesign so when i want to
A :  Project process
A :  Uh satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means if it's a whiteboard digital pens excess
A :  So what i've seen are you are uh since
A :  On to the evaluation of the course of a rather than the evaluation of the project is
A :  My understanding or
A :  So what is your
A :  And remember that nobody system the car yeah yeah
A :  Yep
A :  So um
D :  Initial meeting now
B :  Which is cases quickly and
D :  Yeah
A :  So
A :  I suppose the easiest way of doing it has to put some notes down mm
A :  The channel two
D :  Okay
A :  So yeah i think you have to finish the pink
A :  Right okay
A :  So
A :  Project evaluation and still mm
A :  Um
A :  Creativity
A :  Do you feel you got a chance to express your souls uh-huh well enough
B :  Um yeah
A :  Hmm
D :  I thought some of the divisions are between sort of
D :  The individual meetings with
D :  But all the tree
A :  Individual meeting and you mean
D :  Well
D :  We will find it now various things in
A :  In your on your own
D :  Indeed in between the meetings and paste
D :  It didn't the ball meeting can always call on for the other one you know sort of
D :  Things thrown in the second meeting where
A :  Uh-huh
D :  You know
D :  You'd look to their remote controls assume that curviness ball in the first one you'd also look to some remote controls um
D :  What's the buttons
D :  Oh i understand why are being separate meetings but you do that you need to that
D :  Perfect sense that one or something like that
A :  Mm no the only thing is fine design and manufacturing process you would normally you go to a meeting you say that you do this you do that you do that then you call we
D :  Yeah
A :  You think the information you think um but you then discuss it is the angle and change things are running go back so
B :  Yes was a real would you be going out for any more information each time then
A :  Uh what is this then you really get it from a database or so it's not
B :  Things to be
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh uh anyway so what you want i don't know
A :  Apply seemed okay creativity seemed okay um and fall
A :  All of
A :  Information
A :  Um
A :  On any given subject hmm
A :  Yeah hmmm
A :  Subject um
A :  Sometimes disjointed
D :  Yeah
C :  I think it made it could've been slightly more creative project
C :  When a remote control
C :  It's in the most um
D :  Yeah the thing itself
C :  Kind of fancy thing that you could imagine design and
A :  Uh-huh
C :  I can't think of a better example a banana
A :  Have you could have used
A :  He i. d.s for rent
A :  Example
A :  Oh
A :  To increase
D :  Yeah
B :  Is this k. k. i. "'cause" it's a bit so something of one is about and then
A :  Create
A :  Creativity
B :  Something we kind of these look at and think how we can
A :  You have to do with an a set timeframe as the other thing so
D :  Yeah
D :  Well i was thinking like
D :  To be restricted just say that you have to design a television remote control
D :  In a layer it depends also the business unit i guess i mean
D :  This one seems to want
D :  On the website it looks if it's quite innovative but we come up with some
D :  Okay shot product a way that's you know
A :  Hmm
B :  Buses were saying is like a a computer have like a range of products and
D :  Fifteen created
A :  Uh-huh
A :  I think
B :  Yeah that's the highways by guess that's something else i know it but like a brief to kind of
A :  Uh there
A :  But the other thing is that to them in there
A :  And casing that they're trying to use this uh
A :  So for two
A :  To demonstrate
A :  How you could
A :  Uh huh do the project and i'm not my way for the moment for instance is uh
A :  Acting as a computer
A :  Um
A :  For um you normally you got problems you go to to turn find out
A :  Information to see how to get it fixed so what she's doing it she's
A :  Well how to spend fifty
A :  At the computer channel that one aide so that any student that comes along
A :  Can i ask whatever question
A :  And and you are the idea is that peak which ever uh persons of the other end
A :  Can point in in the right direction
A :  Sure number two year doesn't directly give them help or second main point in another direction
A :  Here at the library or
A :  Uh or or come back or go and see child lock or whatever
A :  So uh
A :  And that was a project
A :  Yeah i suspect similar to this because they
A :  They were actually trying to keep up with the uh computer software
A :  To enable uh to to to to work
A :  And of course you had that
A :  Machine crashing um these things called cool
B :  We should stay to look at the last slide see as anything else planes one
A :  So
A :  Alright so we've got to
B :  Almost care
D :  If you if you look at the product on the website here real reactor
D :  There is a pretty high-tech and
D :  Cutting edge
A :  New ideas found that we find a know
B :  It's regular this um
A :  Hmm
B :  The whiteboard i mean and it just opens like it's a male a male easy
A :  Right
A :  With the ship uh-huh teamwork
D :  So we did find it an idea means that the kinetic
D :  Remote control and i see what i'm the four
D :  No batteries i think so
A :  That's
B :  Well voice recognition especially no warming it
D :  Yeah
A :  You know voice recognition computers are it's not just a remote controls
C :  But the different application okay
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
B :  Yes this is like the same products bit together that some way
A :  So how do you reckon teamwork weren't uh-huh
D :  Okay yeah
B :  Yeah i guess we all had stuff ideas and discuss
A :  To handle or
A :  Reason probably
A :  Wow
A :  Okay
D :  I don't think so just
D :  But but shit
D :  Um
D :  Allowed us to do anything
A :  The r. s. i.
D :  Well i mean i don't think it at that starting if it to do with the rest of the product so mean
D :  And call they said if you know
A :  Mm
D :  High definition t. v. d. and
D :  Paul ball seven inch that um
D :  Like wait
D :  Computer screens and i'm thinking you know one
D :  Cheap remote control doesn't believe
A :  No that's it
A :  So
D :  So this is the chip
A :  One more men to comment on leadership and that means easy whiteboard digital pens etcetera
C :  Leaderships a bit of
A :  And and new new ideas found was that the other thing
D :  Yeah
C :  Pork are really
C :  Old fairly common on leadership because you want the project manager you want a leader
A :  Oh
C :  So
C :  I like pizza leadership wasn't really
C :  As much as your house
D :  Yeah
A :  No i'd much i think that look at it but i hope that room and i certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as a way of like
A :  Over
A :  Um
A :  Right uh it means the whiteboard um so very is uh equipment oh
D :  Yeah
D :  I worked
C :  Yeah very nice
D :  Can i
D :  Computers could be a bit difficult at times but
A :  Uh
C :  But we're not at all i'm not sure i see the value in these i mean
C :  The record we right now and then
C :  What do you assessed way to get the record mm
C :  Do you put in the computer or something
D :  I think
D :  This a little was a little um
B :  Is is that is for us as for the experiments also
D :  It's like there's a little chip i think you must
D :  Linda something in it
B :  If you could a look at the last slide
C :  Right
D :  Produces a
C :  Uh you watch a video of a kind of
D :  I don't know whether to speech use it they gave me just everything you've written or something but
A :  Right
D :  Page after page
A :  New ideas found so one or two uh-huh
D :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  Kinetic
D :  Powered remote control um
D :  Was it a one
C :  Voice um
D :  Yeah
C :  Mission think
A :  Right order mm
A :  And yeah
A :  Voice
A :  Yeah but the voice activated um
D :  Voice recognition yeah
A :  Recognition
D :  Almost
C :  Okay much
D :  The nice to nice questionnaire
A :  Right so um
A :  Mm
D :  I don't know
A :  Uh i would consider them but it uses the project evaluated
A :  Yes
A :  Yeah don't forget we find a questionnaire and meeting summary then celebration
A :  I am
B :  "'cause" "'cause" uh
A :  Uh
B :  So after
D :  I think it would go to questionnaires and uh
A :  Yeah
D :  Upon the last meeting
A :  Yeah so we don't uh-huh
A :  So that we
B :  What
B :  Oh
A :  I tried to save this last time at twelve point three and it doesn't seem to have seen it anywhere
C :  Mm
A :  Mind you the the very last time was was different but
