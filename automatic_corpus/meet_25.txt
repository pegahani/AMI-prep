A :  So you never went
A :  If you have a
A :  Kick-off meeting for the
A :  Design of uh
A :  For the beginning of the new project um
A :  Uh remote control for the design for a new remote control
A :  I'm the project manager chris type of love
A :  And
A :  Yeah
A :  So
A :  I'm first point two
A :  Were um
A :  Opening
A :  Then we get used to more than others and
A :  We speak about
A :  These are we going to design
A :  And take too
A :  Make the project plan
A :  Some discussion
A :  And then we talk for the next meeting
A :  So um
A :  We want to
A :  To do uh new remote control
A :  Has to be original trendy
A :  And user-friendly
A :  Um i think the important points we have to
A :  Talk about our
A :  Uh it's functional design it's conceptual design and
A :  Do you say the detailed design
A :  C. n. and
A :  For that to it we're going um
A :  Well it to work individually and then have meeting
A :  During all day
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  He he

D :  Smiley face
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay
D :  And white board isn't working
D :  No
D :  Next
A :  Next
B :  Just to try to guess who's the user interface designer
A :  Talk about money
D :  Yeah
D :  Not me
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Okay
D :  So
A :  So
D :  Twenty five euro for uh
D :  Remote control
A :  That's the price we want to
A :  That state aim for the price for the remote control
D :  Okay
A :  We um him to do
A :  These profit
D :  She's big number
B :  Also international market
A :  Uh-huh
C :  The um it is it a two million and
B :  Well
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm
A :  For a production cost of hmm
A :  Twelve fifty euro
A :  My small
A :  Yeah
A :  So
A :  Any of you have experience in remote controls
D :  Um yes we have plenty at all
D :  Oh
D :  In fact my daughter likes uh yellow remote controls
D :  Do you see a
D :  They need them to break
A :  So that could be a great yeah yeah um
A :  Application remote controls children proof
D :  Mm hmm yeah he yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Children
B :  Hmm
D :  So she likes the buttons
C :  Yeah but
D :  Which make kick
D :  So
D :  Have to click
A :  So they have to be waterproof
D :  Has to be uh
A :  Maybe
A :  "'cause" they eat
D :  Baby proof
A :  She
D :  Yeah
D :  But and they need has to be very brothers to because even if she's not very tall
D :  She's the
D :  High enough so that that when she
D :  For a two way it's a
C :  Yeah
D :  So it has to be the rubber's
B :  Okay unbreakable
D :  Unbreakable yeah
B :  Uh huh
C :  No we have some tail or something
D :  Yeah
D :  Has to be
D :  Nice looking
D :  Colourful maybe
A :  Or four yeah
B :  But for all that stuff practical
D :  I know from because that nobody has colourful
A :  No that's a good idea
C :  Yeah it's always black colour
D :  Remote controlled always black yeah but this one could be a don't know
A :  Uh-huh
B :  No
D :  Purple
B :  But logo know
A :  I
B :  Okay it just that but that someone a strong it's not it's not like
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  No because you stink
D :  One colour
B :  Otherwise you'll know find it
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah yeah and you can change colours not like the ah
D :  Oh like that for it
C :  Like the phones and these things
D :  Yeah you could change colours yeah
B :  Call
C :  Uh at least for children like one colour
A :  Good idea
C :  And it should be really
C :  In a small a time and
A :  Small also a bunch of sync
C :  Not so big load
A :  Now
A :  Not too much buttons or
C :  Yeah not too much what the
D :  Should it be you know these the remote controls where
D :  They are would be called a universal word remote control so you you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television then it's the remote control for the
D :  The sound system more for your off with you know
D :  Whatever
A :  Yeah
D :  I don't know if it's
A :  Mm
D :  Or if we should have a
D :  Targeted remote control
A :  So i think that's
D :  Colour runs that's easy to use size yeah size matters
D :  Yeah
C :  Colour side
A :  So all you just think it's better of small
A :  And bigger
C :  Yeah minute please
C :  Mm more bigger than these days
B :  Yeah but without and it seems like a lot of this has not arrived okay
A :  Not not too small yeah
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  It is it true for you know and probably live with them
B :  Yeah like a parts right
C :  Yeah
B :  That's all that
D :  But uh what could be different from this from the others that are
C :  Yeah maybe we can change
C :  And the colour of the
C :  At least the frame
D :  Yeah it is the colour of the
C :  So then it depends you are two
C :  Hmmm a menu you can easily moulded that
D :  I think one thing in order of processing this remote control if you remember when people use it to be a bit never find a good but the the right place for some reason d. v. d. t. d. off button when they want to use do
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote controls so
A :  So some kind of like the uh uh with uh um
A :  Um
A :  So there are phone
A :  With the the
A :  A screen that will tell you
B :  No no screen so it's too complex
A :  Okay
D :  Too expensive for twelve euro
C :  Too expensive is it
B :  And maybe not too expensive
A :  And that's
B :  Well it's not my problem that at all okay but it
B :  No screens on a remote controls
D :  I thought it could be on your screen
D :  Which we changed depending on the on the user or even the user some i i prefer to have the off button that the top right
C :  Yeah
D :  So i would have my own design of the remote control because it seems like just a a phone
D :  Touch screen
D :  Remote control
D :  If you if you like
C :  I mean it too
D :  I don't know if it make sense but
C :  It's a two page know you people are very kind of a left-handed so you will assign left uh today is like this
D :  Yeah
C :  Save a red areas like this so
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So that
C :  You or as sits on top should be
A :  So i that that one
C :  On
C :  Yeah
B :  And the total alright good so how many actions do we need to implement it
D :  Maybe
A :  Something
D :  It's possible yes
C :  Leading and we can keep those features and then we can uh
C :  Well you make one working
C :  We can add up on the ones which so was
C :  Yeah like we can make two features and if and that kind of uh use
C :  The switch to four
C :  But i mean operations
B :  I mean if it's less than three is that we can make it to a light yeah
D :  Three buttons you mean
B :  And like three mental states yeah you know what i mean we can just make it so uh
A :  I
B :  Controlled by a brain right
D :  I
A :  I
D :  Hmmm yeah sure
A :  Maybe it's more if there is the software inside but
D :  Yeah
A :  Ask you
A :  Three
B :  Mm hmm
A :  I think if we if we want to or universal remote control that we said like we say before
A :  Me
A :  May need more than three
A :  She bottom three
D :  Yeah more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time
B :  Sure sure
C :  Yeah
B :  But first ten detections you you should know what to do it change channels
B :  You just volume
B :  And that's a mouse
D :  Yeah but process when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
D :  And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five
B :  Uh-huh
B :  You do this
D :  Um no
B :  Change channels
D :  Because i'm only using three or four channels but
C :  Yeah
C :  They keep generally that it's less layers uh christine and then
C :  But that's better and then you can put
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah you can only that one but
A :  I didn't channel ideas
C :  Hmmm bit
A :  I want to go to twenty five and then mm
D :  And then back to do when i was before so that's
A :  Then uh
A :  Also can be yeah
B :  Uh huh
D :  Whichever it was
C :  Yeah you can yeah
A :  Okay that
B :  Go back button that's good
D :  Yeah uh we had that in
B :  I want to do
C :  Yeah the previous but then these are the
D :  In other countries
A :  Mm
D :  Yeah a given the history of so you could like it and do we
C :  Well
C :  Oh ho-ho
A :  I
D :  Present the previous
D :  Then you can watch
D :  What's your uh you can also record your own
D :  Record euro
D :  Sequence of actions
D :  That becomes more complex
A :  I
D :  You could look at what the the other people have to use it
C :  Yeah what do you
D :  There we go
C :  It's an l. c. d. view of
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  Maybe it's there
A :  That's all i think we have form of idea
D :  Okay
A :  And
A :  We're going to meet again in thirty minutes
A :  And um
A :  I want you can
A :  Work on these ideas and try to make it
A :  Uh
A :  The ones that make uh
A :  To say what what are the ones important than one or two one that we don't want
A :  And um maybe more in the technical parts what
A :  We want to
A :  Um
A :  So um
A :  Your personal coach will send you some instruction or
A :  Forty six minutes
D :  What does it and he means and the the user requirements uh that's uh that's for us
B :  Market expert
C :  Marketing
D :  But that's me
A :  I
D :  Of course
C :  The icsi to do it
D :  Mm
D :  Yeah the user requirement specification it's uh huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Think of that
A :  So
D :  So
A :  I think that's all
D :  Meetings or great
B :  Okay
C :  Thank you
B :  Okay
A :  See you in thirty minutes
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Hmm
B :  Uh-huh
