D :  "'kay"
D :  So i
A :  Uh no
D :  I agree
A :  Into the
A :  I sent you
A :  I
A :  It's the detailed design meeting
A :  So we're going
A :  Last meeting
A :  So um
A :  First
A :  Um mark and drama are going to present
A :  Uh the prototype
A :  And then uh some you will propose some uh great cheating good criteria to evaluate this prototype
A :  Then
A :  Well we
D :  Yes
B :  Yes
A :  I think then that
A :  We're going to do some finest to see if a t. v.s if you think about it
B :  It looks like
A :  Right
A :  And uh uh at the end we were that we we then
A :  Evaluate to ourself as a team
A :  And
A :  So first
A :  That's uh
A :  See that was that
C :  Oh here we have a prototype model
A :  Okay and you have some side so
C :  Have you know as a some slides
B :  Yes
B :  And play some slides
A :  That's all thing which yeah
C :  In
B :  Participant three
B :  Well that that
A :  Mm "'kay"
B :  Uh so
B :  This is our
B :  Remote control
B :  It's are walking prototype you can use it now
B :  My switch channels as buttons
B :  So first i present us we can't as as perfect model
B :  And then we'll be some technical specifications
B :  That's
B :  Well so let's start
B :  That's next
B :  We analysed all the fruits and contacted nassau
B :  And though might sound
A :  Uh-huh so
B :  Real good yeah if you can say is that sends the stars uh showings at a wedding right
B :  And um
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Society will accept it
B :  For sure
A :  I
B :  And making someone on the list of different fruits we she's able to wait for all to make colours
B :  And uh able to my smile for it
B :  Please next slide
B :  But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium i. d. or
B :  "'cause" it's uh most of those anymore the same
B :  As they are more than material we can
B :  Select
B :  And it's practical
B :  And associates from it so
B :  Please press something
B :  And as i said
A :  "'kay" it at at that
C :  That that that that
B :  This process
C :  Next yes
A :  Yeah
B :  And one is no it's really really glad to
B :  Jane and
D :  Such a nice
C :  See these these uh huh
B :  Session a recession device
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So you can touch it was or a hands
D :  Can i have a
B :  Sure
C :  You can
B :  Yes
D :  Yeah
A :  What do you say
D :  It says
D :  Oh oh oh
B :  That's a
D :  I'll buy it
A :  I know when they
D :  Yeah he is a need so
D :  Hopefully my daughter will like it
B :  Okay
D :  Mm
B :  And that would that sounds are uh it is yes of course
D :  Yes of course of
D :  Course
B :  That was next that
B :  Um this is a prototype you can
B :  Have a look at it and
B :  That's all i wanted to say
B :  Now it's technical specification but or
B :  Calling
C :  So
D :  There's a button missing
D :  Okay
C :  This this you look like silly
D :  Option that
C :  Yeah
C :  So function uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So it as we discussed
C :  We are to switch on switch off
C :  I know we want
C :  And so we have buttons
C :  And using l. c. d. or like you can use these in stock real and
C :  Select each other option on the t. v. and then
C :  Do on and off
C :  Then you'll you'll have volume control
C :  So you you can
C :  Press these modems to increase or decrease
C :  The volume
C :  And we have some l. c. d. controls
C :  Like
C :  The siege in the l. c. d. display if you want to use it c. d. or you don't want you can issues
C :  Normal button
C :  And we have
C :  Speech recogniser
C :  Here you have microphone and then
C :  Repeat reports or ones and then they'd recognise
C :  And you can watch and the reaction
A :  I
C :  And location finder
C :  And we want to build the location basically using speech recogniser
D :  Uh-huh
C :  You can use a yeah
C :  Where's my remote control or are you can use be some nicknamed your remote control
A :  I
C :  Ball we do
A :  Probably
C :  And then
D :  Bob
C :  It is a higher
D :  That that bob
C :  Yeah hi and then
A :  Mm
C :  You can use it
D :  That's good
C :  So um
C :  Uh-huh or do we still fruits
C :  Minutes probably
C :  So you can
C :  Have
D :  Well these are from
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And then
C :  You can see the locator c. d.
C :  And all the sweetest
A :  Uh or four yeah
C :  Material
C :  You want to stick to it titanium
A :  Thank you
C :  He was saying we want to
D :  Fruits betting spongy tight and it up
D :  I didn't really do exist but that's great
C :  Yeah or
C :  So do you want to have
C :  Simple and perfect shapes
C :  Okay so i mean these phones
C :  You can have your own gaze and then
C :  And you can feel
C :  Simple
C :  Designs
C :  And you can choose colours
C :  On your day
C :  For eats
A :  Oh oh
C :  D. or even many colours
D :  You mean we can change the colour or
A :  That's for the l. a.
A :  C. d. or for the titanium
C :  For the l. c. d.
D :  Okay um has to be
C :  The state denim it's a similar
D :  Did i very nice
B :  We're still working on titanium so
D :  Okay
B :  Was that was the l. c. d. you can ask a ball
C :  Yeah
B :  It's to use these
D :  Nobody's
A :  There you go
A :  I think today
D :  They colour
C :  Yeah even you can call in favour you colours for its they're doing on
C :  You're more north
A :  Hmm
D :  Back for sound
C :  Yeah many colours on weekends or
A :  And wait what what are the stories i
D :  On the l. c. d. or
A :  Yeah
C :  Are these are like sensors
A :  Mm hmm i
D :  Of course what you think
B :  That's like a
D :  It's rubber is sensor with
D :  Very useful
A :  Okay
A :  Mm hmm strobe rooms
C :  So
C :  After this meeting will propose
C :  The party for or sex as for the
A :  Uh
D :  Eighteen
C :  So you if you're a vegetarian or you have any options please let us more
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah and we can just did some summary
C :  Yeah
A :  I
A :  Mm hmm
D :  Uh huh interestingly
C :  It's a nice place
C :  Which stands for
D :  Do anything mm
A :  Uh ruud
A :  We'll see in the the financial part different
D :  Yeah me
A :  Well that's a
A :  I think i think
B :  Let's make it but you first two
C :  Yeah then we can discuss we can
A :  The flavour fifty median something first make a part
C :  Yeah then we can help
C :  To find mine is left out
D :  What the design
A :  Okay
A :  Uh so
D :  It's my turn
A :  It's uh yeah let's see if it hits need the evaluation criteria
D :  Mm hmm
D :  That's easy
D :  If you meet
A :  Yeah
D :  Even haitian criteria
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Four
D :  Yeah so we have edition please
D :  So you made a very nice prototype and um i think we now need all together too
D :  I tried to evaluate it to see if we make sense to do it
D :  If we if we fees our
D :  What are you wanted to and things like that
D :  So
D :  And next slide please
D :  As you go
D :  Before going and you're creating in producing these
D :  Six rubbery you
D :  Remote control it's very important as the reserve a if it makes sense if we have a chance to set it
D :  So we need to be evaluated and tried to do it in a constructive way
D :  In as much as we can
D :  Two so what i'd propose is that we're going to
D :  Have this came from one to seven one meeting that
D :  You you it's uh it for sees the the criteria whatever it is and seven meeting will we doesn't succeed at all
D :  Well that's going to use all the criteria i'm going to go to the next slide and to get it right to
D :  Evaluate this according to these criteria and then from one to seven and then
D :  We're just going to have an average which we give us these bad you off or
D :  Yeah uh remote control
D :  So
D :  Maybe we can have a look at the criteria
D :  So these are the criteria and uh i
D :  I thought were important of course this can be discussed that
D :  That's
D :  Let's see so let's suppose so we have fancy here
D :  And we have this scale
D :  From one
D :  Seven
D :  We have for in the middle
D :  So
C :  Yeah what's is
D :  What do you think is it fancy
C :  Alright silly
A :  Yeah i think that fancy we can say it "'cause" i think
D :  It is there a very fancy are
D :  Have you ever seen something like that
A :  I am not that the only one
D :  Yeah of course
A :  Choosing yeah
D :  What do you think
A :  What do you think
B :  Feels the weight
D :  Oh wait is that later
A :  I
B :  Oh okay
D :  Where and that's fancy that's no i think it's quite fancy to
C :  Yeah we can do it display or six and
D :  Yeah so no it's it's one
A :  It's in the other yeah
D :  Yeah oh well i mean this yes a very fancy and senate mean that'll at all
C :  Welcome back
C :  Well "'cause"
D :  So it's one or two would you think
A :  Two minutes
C :  Maybe
D :  Okay
B :  Two two
D :  So here too
D :  Then we have uh technologies
C :  No nothing
C :  Yeah
D :  So what about technology we have a have speech recognition have location based
C :  And they don't c. d.
D :  You can service we have a c. d.
C :  Sorry
A :  Change score
D :  Change the colour i mean that's very
C :  Change colour
C :  This one
A :  Yeah i think it's a
D :  Quite that i think it's a one for that
C :  Yeah that's it
B :  Yeah
D :  He's the one yeah
D :  Well that's nice uh huh
C :  Uh it's do we need to see
D :  So for nets wasn't my daughter take it and then
A :  Mm
D :  And throw it away do you think it makes sense that it's going to leave again the
D :  Flying
D :  Oh my god
C :  Mister of it
D :  Okay we just last one is properly
B :  No no
D :  But it all out
B :  I gonna say this
C :  Yeah we can easily it
B :  He'll it's still walking
B :  Yeah that that that that bought those
B :  The story
D :  So it's not so bad i am i would say three
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah i have needs to pick
D :  But does make sense yeah
A :  Robust
C :  This one
D :  Yeah so that
D :  Well so the question is do you have that the minimum requirement of a remote control
C :  Yeah
D :  So i don't know all these buttons are not here but you have at least there
A :  Ah yeah let's meet right
C :  Yeah
D :  Next
A :  What is a negative values
D :  Previews
C :  Yeah it's i had these is volume control and ten a genius
D :  It depends on
C :  So the main
D :  Okay
A :  And you can then
A :  Did did two sides
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  And you can deal
C :  On the l. c. d. using these
A :  Okay well so
C :  Going to scrolling all the option
D :  Because the l. c. d. "'s" not that does control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five
A :  You can buy using the
B :  Okay
D :  Directly
B :  You go you so is the basic mould
A :  Push yeah that there
B :  Yeah so that's simple basic mould it easy but just two buttons
D :  Yeah
B :  And the jog dial
D :  Well it's a jog dial
B :  Buttons you do is this like
B :  That one "'em" up volume down
C :  And down and
B :  Or if you go to the side it's a channel up channel down
D :  Okay
B :  And if you want to make just twenty five
B :  You push buttons it's
D :  Yeah
C :  You can sell it
B :  You select trendy you select
B :  Five
D :  Ah
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah
D :  It's much older than
B :  No
D :  That being to to five know talking things out
D :  Yeah okay we can go that's it you're right
C :  A unique to like press two and five
D :  It's less uh
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  But it's it's nice because people in you would all go there
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  So what do you think for it
D :  Use for this
A :  Mm
D :  Is to be useful
C :  Yeah they need it as we want we wanna do is to main functions here and other functions will be on the l. c. d. so
A :  Between this time that because i'm not sure that's for
D :  Wolf
A :  Didn't use one i'm the to the television on button you have to
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  But longer that's right yeah
A :  And which button is that
B :  It's a jog dial for controlling the course or on the l. c. d. screen like selector the menus
C :  And easiest job
A :  Okay okay it's okay oh okay okay
C :  C. n. l. c. d. like
C :  You will have blocked and you select which one
A :  Well okay great
D :  I would say then yeah
A :  Yeah it's looks euros useful
D :  Two or three
D :  Two or three
C :  Cool
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Okay
D :  So size and weight
C :  Yeah
D :  Is it that the detective size and weight that uh is it uh
D :  Real sized wait wait or
C :  Yeah it's i use um i must say
D :  Because it is
D :  Size is going to be that yeah
C :  Yeah that was it just
D :  Um
C :  But it will be
C :  Like every was
B :  Sure was out the titanium um oh it's going to the light
C :  Hmmm be used titanium
C :  Yeah
D :  It's going to be later because it seems to be very handy if they're in for my daughter for instance
B :  Of course
A :  I
D :  Not sure if she can use it
C :  But sex the the side should be okay that's good
D :  Should be okay
D :  Hope to three for that
D :  Because i haven't seen the weight so uh
B :  Oh okay
D :  Most
B :  Okay
D :  So uh
D :  Colour and shape
A :  Ah
D :  Well also colour it seems that we have the the role colours for the l. c. d.
D :  Yeah and it's not very clear what is the colour of this dish
D :  Case
C :  The case use it or titanium
A :  Yeah i see dead
D :  It's going to be titanium okay okay that's nice
A :  It's much in
D :  I think it's good okay
A :  And what about the strawberries and the top i am not convinced that
D :  The home
A :  Maybe i'm not trendy bit too
D :  Well you know it's these uh fruit and vegetable here so
A :  Yeah but they're they're and they're not useful in
C :  So maybe i think
A :  They did say
D :  I think yes well the reason as a as a word and just have to remind you that you so this is much less important than fanciness
C :  Yeah
D :  Whether it's fancy and that now
D :  We have to decide this
A :  Would have a a a found more fancy that's the fruits are useful
D :  That's all that them
D :  But maybe different maybe here it's uh
A :  Yeah
C :  You know then it should be defeated use more like this they're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more
A :  Uh-huh
A :  But the mm yeah
C :  Detections all
C :  So
C :  Maybe t. v. can have rub or or some spongy's stuff or strawberries and
C :  Different colours
C :  So
D :  Oh it's in italy uh
D :  It's a two year and the shape the
A :  I'm not sure i i why a yeah if it was like this
C :  Make its but it looks really
A :  It's a one
C :  I'm not really doing
A :  And i think the advanced anymore
C :  Yeah
C :  So these are kind of rubber things even if you lose one you can use pork what or
A :  Okay
B :  And really
C :  In the controller many different colours are different from
A :  Ah i'm not sure it's
B :  More more all it powers it covers all the angles
A :  I see no
C :  Yeah
B :  Even if it is you know it's very round it but still we got some rubber fruit here and it's completely
B :  That completely secure to leave it was children
A :  Okay so you you you feel a key something uh
C :  Yeah
A :  A protection for the remote control
C :  Yeah
C :  You have you you have you have sensors here and
C :  So here here's all
A :  Also
C :  It is yeah so even if you don't put people "'cause"
C :  But the usually
C :  Fancy
D :  I'd say just a three
A :  Okay
D :  Because uh everybody's doesn't seem to be convenience although it's quite you have good arguments
D :  But
D :  And the the last one is a back to use this is not maybe not as important as it a one
C :  Yeah
D :  But the kind we adopted to each each person would use
B :  Sure sure just look at that
D :  Great
B :  Well that that that
D :  If we do that then
A :  Uh with that
B :  Fit it into
D :  Do your palm okay
A :  E. a.
D :  What else can we need you do you think you are gonna be able to do that we've been fighting about
C :  You can
A :  Yeah it's verge titanium
D :  It's yeah yeah yeah fruit data
A :  Yeah yeah yeah
D :  Well uh if if this is if you're not to do that then i think it deserves a one
C :  Ah okay
A :  That's control button
D :  Okay
D :  Now we have to do the average
C :  Mm thing
C :  He
D :  We could do that
C :  Mm
B :  It's two point one seven
D :  Okay
D :  Two point one seven
D :  That's nice to point one seven out of seven
D :  I think we
D :  Have a good
D :  The thing
D :  Well that's all i had to say about the evaluation
A :  So weeks ago the very cheap
D :  It seems to be good yeah
D :  We have uh
C :  That one one seven yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Thanks
A :  Okay
D :  Uh
A :  So oh no it has to fulfil the financial um criteria
C :  And
A :  So i have that
A :  It's yeah
A :  Uh-huh
C :  In its e. o. we
D :  So how many batteries do we need
C :  One battery
D :  One battery
A :  Okay so too
D :  One two
C :  Well we just need one of those
D :  Signal
D :  No that different style
D :  Two batteries are one
A :  Oh
C :  No number is one mean you don't want that
D :  When you want
A :  Yeah yeah but the prices to
D :  No no no no no the no
A :  A number sorry sorry sorry i'm sorry
C :  Number and
B :  You just
B :  Number
D :  You never use an excel
A :  Never
D :  Yeah
B :  What was the minutes
A :  I
B :  Ah it's it's okay that i don't know it's uh it's not my fear of twelve bucks
D :  Well but
D :  Twelve bucks twelve and a half i think
B :  Okay yeah
C :  So we are
B :  Jim "'s" that number also
A :  I
D :  Okay electronics
C :  We have sample it's a one it's
D :  It's a simple chip
C :  And with u. p. s.
D :  Simple chip okay one
C :  Yeah four buttons uh yes
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
C :  And then we have
A :  And for the
C :  The sample speaker or sense are for speech recognition
A :  Yeah
A :  One one so
D :  What are two one
C :  You know
C :  Yeah one
D :  Okay
D :  So the case which one is uh is it yeah
C :  Yeah can you go for single even
D :  This is single curve
C :  Uh is done
B :  It's it's flat
D :  It's not
C :  Well i think
D :  And curved
A :  I thought you can good thing
C :  Oh okay
D :  Okay it's probable
B :  It's flat yeah
B :  It's garbled buttons
D :  Maybe there's a supplement for another one so
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Is on the curve okay that's good
A :  I say i i think i think that
A :  Uh it's it's this one
D :  Is ah okay yeah
A :  Done she can i
C :  But uh
D :  We tried it right
C :  One
B :  Oh okay
D :  So what is it done by then yeah um
C :  A pentium
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Mm that's expensive
B :  Mm
A :  That she wanted a fried steak and am i think it's five but
D :  Okay
C :  Yellow
D :  Just faded
D :  Special colour know
B :  Well and white three or three
C :  No no one no
A :  Oh sorry can you can see
C :  Interface
A :  Special colour
A :  Oh it's funny and uh
C :  Yes unit c. d. display
A :  Yeah but
A :  There is no
C :  Yeah mm
A :  Or here so i put it here
C :  Push what button
D :  So the l. c. d.
A :  How many pushbutton tree or two
C :  Oh
A :  Is there the scroll-wheel okay
D :  Expensive
C :  One school mm
C :  One minute see
C :  Display
A :  Uh
A :  Um
A :  That's that's non we choose this one um and this one
D :  That's all right
D :  Well i think know it's is it the scroll wheel and the pushbutton the the centre one
A :  Only a scroll wheel
D :  Or only
C :  Well you scroll wheel
D :  Well you scroll wheel okay
C :  Yeah
C :  So
D :  I think
A :  In practice i know
D :  Make to have
C :  It's only
D :  A goes up
A :  How do you do too
A :  I mean
A :  Select
D :  Well they use it into that too deep yeah the two buttons and
A :  Yeah i mean you you go on the location we easier scroll wheel and then they
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah and then it automatically
D :  Yeah
C :  You can use to like if you it goes then it will activate
A :  Stay longer ah okay
D :  This is the yeah
C :  Say it's crazy c. d.s
A :  Okay okay
A :  Um
C :  Special colours yeah
B :  Four buttons
C :  Yeah but and sends probably these hmm
B :  But that's just normal
C :  Special form
A :  You you have all of these know
D :  She's very hard on us
A :  Uh i
D :  Special colour
A :  Hmm maybe in not this one it's
D :  Yeah no special not a real
C :  Um we have a ten
B :  That's four buttons the buttons last time that
D :  Yeah buttons are all standard buttons it's only buttons
A :  Yeah so
D :  Nothing special
D :  Okay so we're at seventeen but eh
A :  Not special colours and so
D :  Well the colour is in the l. c. d.
A :  And the buttons are not colour eyes
D :  I know
A :  Uh
C :  Mm nightingale as you can use more for
D :  We can just use these red
C :  Wood colours
C :  Yeah
D :  It's
A :  Cool cool
A :  It's already too expensive
A :  Trendy
D :  So what is that we supposed to cut things out now
D :  That and feel get twelve
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Fifty
C :  Cool
D :  Oh
A :  Mm
A :  It's all seen go for a week uh-huh
A :  Got here
D :  Hmm well
D :  If a look at what is the most expensive things that it's d. a. c. d. and this speaker
C :  Sample speaker
C :  Yeah
A :  Apparently we have true's one or the other
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  While assuming know there's some research done in the field of produce a manager from mechanical engineering produce and it's just for mechanical energy
B :  So the point is that when you take the device and push the button you produce enough energy
A :  But you don't need a battery
B :  To make electricity yeah that you don't need a battery
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So it sounds like a hand dynamo about
B :  Yeah real fight they were fine
D :  So that would
A :  But the um
A :  It's like the hand dynamo
C :  Maybe the dark we can we do have
D :  So but if we said at the hand dynamo it's okay we only we we win one
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
D :  That's already there okay have that
A :  It's a it's the beginning okay
B :  One of those does that
D :  Hmm
A :  One yeah you
C :  It just to
B :  And how i propose to so uh about shapes advanced chip-on-print right
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So put a minus one there please
A :  I
D :  Yeah i i'm not sure this is legal
A :  Mm
B :  Why not
A :  That's right
C :  Uh-huh
B :  And then
A :  Mm maybe minus uh
A :  Tree
D :  No
D :  Okay that's it
