A :  Yes i
A :  Thank you
C :  Oh
A :  What
A :  Okay
A :  Good morning to do twenty
C :  Good money
D :  Good morning
B :  Good morning
A :  So
A :  We
A :  I'll ask a two
A :  To make here
A :  A new remote control
A :  Four
A :  To deviation
A :  And
A :  Be
A :  That is fixable it's new
A :  Remote control
A :  Should be
A :  Or easy know
A :  And
A :  Twenty
A :  And of course user
A :  User friendly
A :  No you could and uh can use it
A :  To uni
A :  And uh huh
A :  I don't know
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Well i think we should
C :  So at the the points to to try to project and uh
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Did you say there's an email about this
A :  Oh uh not yet
A :  But if you want
B :  Yeah we we received an email about this
B :  The the designs
A :  You want
A :  You want me to send you mean
B :  I
B :  I i suck yeah
A :  Or
D :  Or we can put it in the shared folder
B :  Yeah you see the email
B :  U. c. d. c. eighteen say the mail the very
D :  No one and that's it
B :  No no the first uh
B :  Inside
A :  Uh
D :  This one
B :  No
D :  No
B :  That that uh
B :  Well i didn't do anything
D :  Now i'm i'm marketing
B :  Strange
B :  Uh-huh
B :  I got a know about the disk about this discussion
B :  Yeah
A :  You get in a problem
B :  I don't know from you
A :  No
C :  Yeah from the account manager
B :  And they come in a two year is it the same yeah right
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  I think is for your that as to how to design it on all the aspects so you need that information
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah i think so
B :  Yes it each of us has a role to do
D :  Yeah i don't know much or less i knew of roles
A :  It's a
B :  Units
B :  So we really have our old
A :  For each for each one
D :  For each boston yeah
B :  Kidding
A :  So that so we have any is yeah we have functional design conceptual design and
B :  So that we can sort of designs that's all
B :  Okay
A :  That idea sorry
B :  Alright
A :  So who will be t.
A :  It's possible for sure you so you need you want to you know
C :  I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we need in our major we received from the account manager
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Oh
B :  And in interface
A :  We are going to
C :  No and and it's
B :  Be using that you're doing mean
C :  Yeah i i manage
C :  Well maybe we have
C :  Okay so it's it's industrial design
C :  It was a little confusion about my yeah
B :  Ah
C :  But it's alright
B :  Okay
A :  Okay are
A :  For n. b. c. and design
C :  Yeah
A :  And
A :  You
A :  Number
B :  Um working only
B :  User interface
A :  Mm
A :  And
D :  Uh i meant marketing
A :  But i mean the marketing
D :  Oh and yeah nothing much in the project
A :  Nothing related here too
D :  Marketing in this design
D :  Design is this kind of four industrial design and user interface
B :  Yes that's
B :  You see the second them
B :  Yeah it's inside
B :  No no
B :  Appendix
D :  Yeah this is all
B :  I think these are all for a really
D :  Yeah this one first response
B :  Even for the marketing
D :  Is that the first is that you find it
A :  Yes
B :  But look at your role
B :  You're marketing wrong
D :  As a trend watching
A :  I don't know
B :  Yeah that's euro
A :  Well it's
C :  Well i think
C :  We can have a little discussion about what has to be done
C :  And
C :  What are your ideas about uh
A :  About the design know
A :  Maybe we discussed use it or not
C :  When we what we want to have a new
C :  With a remote control for for t. v. distribution i guess
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So we have to if if plan how how we would be developed and uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Hmm
C :  How we can make it work
B :  Yes
D :  I'm and working once we already have it should be something different
D :  From the other remotes
D :  Remote controls
C :  Yeah i don't know
A :  But b. "'s"
A :  We have to keep in mind d.
A :  It's
A :  Characteristics
A :  And of course it
A :  Should not be the cost
D :  Yeah that's right
C :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Well i i think the norm and i would
C :  Think about um
C :  The technical points
C :  And um
C :  Yeah we should discuss it in the next meeting or
B :  Need to collect information
C :  Yeah if you
A :  About the board but
B :  Um
B :  Uh-huh and above the design perhaps
B :  Uh what is most important in uh
B :  In uh remote control
B :  What is the most important function uh aspect
A :  You mean be extend the
A :  Well spectral
C :  Well you have to make it work
B :  I
A :  I see
B :  It's a right
C :  But that's the big thing
B :  Yeah it should be easy to what we've
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  We can think about an interface with a one
B :  You maybe you can have a speech should uh recognition interface is still the
B :  Television my one which channel
B :  Or
A :  You want
B :  Or you can say for example um
B :  I one uh do this all the programme to mine you know in this is tell this to
B :  Uh remote control
B :  It's doing this um searching for you so you'd have to look for the channel you went to say
B :  Maybe i just wanna press a wanna have a button for the movies tonight
B :  Or button for the magazines all the information document very polite
B :  And then you lisa feel in a choose from at least
B :  So is there pressing the channel number i'm choosing the programs that it be
A :  Right
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  That's one way of um making it useful
A :  Exactly
A :  I think if we go to the lot of technology on the remote operated is a constant
B :  No
B :  Because
B :  No
B :  So there are a lot did this information like this
D :  Yes
B :  For example you can get um
A :  Likes you you you say we can use speech
B :  I think it's uh well for example anything
C :  Yes
B :  Eh the the with the idea of using speech to redo the button
B :  But uh any small later on
C :  I think if you wanted to choose uh from a list of program our something like that so you you may have to to use um uh uh
B :  Yeah
D :  On ah okay
B :  Yeah
C :  I don't know
D :  Oh and the main no no function of remote control is to have something in the hand and they should be very careful about the size of the remote control if they want to have a speech interface
A :  They're gonna do
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  I'm not sure but then trendy slim size of the remote control
B :  Yes but
D :  To be able to put a speech if you if you want to put a speech recognition system interface for that
D :  I think the t. v. itself could have it
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  And i could talk to the t. v. television itself i mean not have an
A :  Exactly
A :  If you are far from the t. v.
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  Yeah and we have some uh rare saw something different economic
C :  I
A :  Yeah yes
B :  Yeah but the the main idea on that i wanted to say is that
A :  It's
B :  Um and they should be a function is that using that should t. v. channel there's a option you can just add a t. v. channels or
A :  I was uh
A :  That's
A :  So
C :  On the card sounds
B :  Or four or do or the content no not all the contents of the programme
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah yeah that's a good idea it's a good idea but
B :  So it's more powerful
A :  No
C :  I i think that technically would be a little bit uh
B :  No
C :  Um or tricky to to achieve d.s don't know
B :  No because you see it now all the t. v. programs that available on the whips
B :  Big they're they're they are available in the x. m. l. format or whatever form and we don't care because it it it so some content
B :  It's a standard should the content and then that's it's all them by the types of programs
A :  I saw them
B :  So on the website they are they provide this uh v.s so we can this use the so these are available
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Downloaded the the the um
B :  To this remote control
B :  And then there's the only six buttons for six categories also so when the most they only seven buttons
B :  So that's just the category one and you use the same button for example to
C :  Yeah
A :  It it
B :  To choose among but that's up at least the for anyone so it it you don't have to choose them on
B :  Hundred channels if you have hundred channels it does have six buttons the buttons
A :  Yeah we should also optimise be the number of
C :  Well i i think that's
A :  Access
A :  This is a good idea
C :  Just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen
C :  Mm we are able to um navigate through through the
B :  Oh yes so yellow
C :  Well channel program are content so in the easy way yeah so it's
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah so you don't have a display you just split on the t. v. screen right
C :  Yeah
C :  Need this country screen and just uh we did which are remote control would just navigate through the
B :  Good idea
B :  Okay
B :  I think i think that v. reporter you volition the u. i. because of the t. v. you read the the the remote control have a all numbers
C :  If
D :  No
B :  Lots of buttons and then you don't know what the choose the end
C :  Yeah yeah so
B :  Right
C :  I think for the for the technical points
C :  We have to to to check out to gather the the telephone
C :  Programme or
C :  Contents and
C :  All this stuff
B :  Okay
A :  So we have five minutes to
B :  Are we we we have sometimes the use the whiteboard
A :  Uh you can you can you can use it if you
B :  But i mean if
D :  Another interesting idea for this or they do have and like adaptation system depending upon the picture or or
A :  So we're gonna use it
B :  Okay
B :  Okay
D :  So i'm and if you're watching a movie and so on a there's a dark well
B :  Yeah
D :  Some dark seen the light so that themselves the lighting in the room change s.
B :  Yeah but we're designing this remote control
C :  Oh
D :  Okay
A :  Really but the tester i was gonna
D :  I'm and you have the option in the remote control if we want to have that option you press that button in the remote
C :  Uh right so mm
B :  Okay d. and the have a concept uh remote control their eyes is one of the function in
A :  Yeah you you you can if you want to go to the right away table
B :  I
C :  Please number and draw uh huh
B :  I go in draw something or
C :  Three
D :  Well i'm afraid of a lot to put a lot but
B :  Or is it
D :  The lab and
A :  Well before they before the in the design that's as you want
B :  Oh okay
B :  Or is it yeah
D :  Yeah that one
D :  Just plug it
A :  Number
D :  Yeah for
A :  But before before right so you can
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Seat uh that's that's you want to be
A :  What he said and
A :  After that you can and used to it
B :  Okay alright
B :  So
B :  So are the most functional and is the most important function isn't should true uh buttons to choose the content
B :  Right we agree on there
C :  Okay
B :  Uhuh
B :  Of the size of the
B :  Uhuh
B :  Buttons
B :  Yeah or it could be anything with the buttons
A :  Yeah
B :  Uhuh
B :  That shows
B :  Uh com k.
B :  Or or channels so we have both the user can choose which which one they wanna
C :  Hmm but yeah by content or by china it's a good idea
B :  By content know by channel
B :  Choose
B :  By content so my channels
B :  So
B :  And then what do we say the snow
B :  Other than this
C :  And then we would have to find a way how to gather information about the contents
B :  Okay
B :  So technically have how that
B :  The problems that
B :  How to do it
B :  Used to um
B :  How to get the content
C :  Yeah
B :  Challenge
C :  I think it it's not very difficult to browse but channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by content so
B :  Okay
B :  Calm yeah
B :  Okay
B :  So these are the work at all since is one problem
B :  Uh
C :  I think that's the main things to do and um
B :  The main thing
D :  Mm
C :  Through uh
B :  Okay
B :  Alright
C :  In fact about it and
B :  I i okay so is that
C :  Discuss it in the next meeting
B :  The discussing know gets a voice say the next meeting so for now we get
B :  Uh the five this is the fashion the design aspect
B :  It's the first aspect
B :  Right
B :  But again information and then they would come back and
C :  Okay
B :  Well
C :  Thank you everybody
A :  Okay i
B :  Yeah we have to have
A :  So maybe we meeting
A :  Maybe five minutes
B :  Alright
A :  Right we discussed be either
B :  Ah right okay
A :  Uh-huh aspect
C :  Okay
B :  Thank you nice
A :  Okay
A :  Well in china cat
C :  Yeah
