D :  I think
C :  Hmm
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Right but i still believe
D :  Mm
D :  No
D :  Well
C :  Um
B :  Yeah
A :  I
C :  Okay
C :  I
C :  And we are
C :  So do we wanna that same format as last time so so you must switching over just left or
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Forced to screen to
C :  Um
C :  I have
C :  Mail to use the minutes of the last meeting
C :  Yeah just to save time
D :  Okay cool
C :  Um and
C :  Is there any questions you have to rise the last meeting that
C :  Particular bother me
D :  Mm um
C :  Mm
D :  No i don't think so
C :  No okay cool
C :  Then we should start with
C :  A presentation right
B :  Yeah
B :  Have you guys again
B :  Uh
B :  In this meeting i i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
B :  Um how this trend is going to affect a remarkable attention and how important is it is
B :  So we have to look on this
B :  First of all methodology
B :  They might lead to do it in
B :  To find out that and was into the lower than in a way
B :  Uh we have done it is it not only these a remote control market so there but we also considered the greatest threat fashion trends of the market
B :  "'cause" we think that
B :  This is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit
B :  So what are our findings in a very uh you know findings we have seen that
B :  When we did other remote control market so we we found that
B :  Uh people are a little uh uh people do have preference for a those fancy more one of the remote control switch look and feel a vote better than having a functional look and feel so good
B :  So this shit this clearly indicates to a preference for the design the the outlook of the remote controls so we should take into uh so we should consider this vector is the most important factor of this vector it is
B :  Twice as important
B :  The second factor which is for that to do is they as important as the side uh so the third factor so this vector one of the most important factor in others are uh
B :  Uh in our market um means and take in designing our um our uh remote controls
D :  The last one is most important one is uh oh sorry
B :  No the first one you see uh d. outlook of them or why these should have a fancy or not
D :  Okay
B :  As a fancy design
D :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  Other than just having a functional look and feel good
B :  You should have a fancy look and for the feel good
B :  The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically a you know a t. v.
B :  We must have some technology that it was meant in the remote control that other than just putting it as it is
B :  As the other or a remote control so
B :  So it should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition or something like that
B :  So that endeared somewhere technological advancement
D :  Hmm
B :  And
B :  That are the most important aspect in the data to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Like a sure i would too much go complicated they shouldn't be too many buttons on the small uh remote control which are a bit too complicated
B :  Yeah it
B :  Like this uh and it should we uh and customers should be provided with the mental state is easy to understand in the local language something
B :  So that they would know how to use
B :  These remote controls
B :  When we did uh
B :  Fashions uh this and fashion the holidays and fashion update shows that
D :  Sorry
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  I was really think fruit and vegetables
A :  Mm
B :  Yeah
D :  How to know how we're going to incorporate that i i
B :  Yeah uh
B :  Yeah we have to because
B :  Uh that you can see how people have a later date clothes shoes and furniture everything that fruit and veggie day was
D :  I
B :  Uh the in the world is not changing use ten plus organic
D :  Okay
B :  Becoming more and more organic
A :  Should make a big sponge one
B :  You know in
D :  Yeah ah
B :  Yeah i had
A :  Yeah be yellow
B :  So
A :  Yeah
D :  That's very good
B :  Yeah
B :  So something like that doing
D :  Well in the top
B :  We should do
D :  Okay
B :  And
B :  Beep a uh dave and feel of the material is expected to be spongy the other than just having a plastic look a hard look
D :  Well that's good that's all we kind of
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Pretty good today
B :  So so that that could play with it by hand it yeah we're handling it
D :  Okay
B :  So they should also taken into consideration
D :  Okay
B :  So these are my views
D :  Okay
D :  Okay the spongy
B :  So
D :  Not real spongy can
B :  Uh it got
D :  Do you think like rubber would be good odds are really want you know
B :  Um well the data but it is good for have ten which is quite this was a one
D :  Channel kind of
D :  Okay quite this baseball
B :  That we can begin to go yeah "'cause" uh you sure and we have any harm to the environment also because our company is very light up there for taking all this concerns into consideration
D :  Okay
D :  Oh okay
D :  Uh huh
B :  So we don't want to have any harm to the society
D :  Okay
B :  So
D :  Cool
C :  Mm
B :  So that's all
C :  Fruit and veg
C :  There you go
B :  Yeah
C :  Just well i think of one to think of a
D :  Mm
D :  I remote control
A :  Um
C :  The remote control
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh next to your hand
D :  And know whether any factors the ones important than the seven eight that they said we paint
D :  One
B :  It's a winner and find out a nice that's fine
D :  Or was it was
D :  Okay yeah yeah
B :  Mm uhuh
B :  Yes there could be what we could and find out any
D :  Cool
B :  Uh
C :  Mm mm
D :  And
D :  What is it um
C :  Function f. eight
D :  Yeah
D :  O. k.
A :  But still yeah
B :  Yeah you're suggesting
B :  No
D :  The signal
B :  Yes
D :  That aren't they
A :  No it's got it's got it
B :  Yeah yeah yeah
B :  It's just
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay and then f. five right
B :  Mm
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Um
D :  Okay
D :  So the interface concept
D :  Um
D :  Yeah
D :  The interface specification what people
D :  And how they interact with that basically i think
D :  Um mm
D :  So the method we did the existing designs one of the what's good about them what's bad at them
D :  Um let's have to also going to look at us "'cause" everything
D :  Um and
D :  What's that
D :  Just have a told is and what we think would be good
D :  It's a bit of imagination
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh the findings are got some pictures to say as well
C :  So much that is the rocket either
D :  "'kay" yeah
D :  Okay it's a maze to remote controls is graphical interface where you
D :  And have cops
D :  Hmmm buttons and you point to it rather than having the output is uh
D :  Stream of text or something
C :  Uh huh
D :  Um and we also found that is inconsistent layout which makes it confusing so i think for a remote control
D :  There is some inconsistency already nick existing in between remote controls by things stand that kind of
D :  And shape and
D :  Up in a in this kind of button buttons like that the top right so on and off or something i think people find that important "'cause" and it's easy to use
C :  Right okay yeah
D :  And we got some pictures of some uh a new remote controls to show you that press escape f. five
C :  And i just escape
D :  Or just
D :  It's "'kay" okay
D :  Um oh so i had a lot
D :  Yeah okay so it
D :  These are the some of the pictures of
D :  Existing ones
A :  Oh
D :  Has to look through them
D :  This so and is that a voice recognition
D :  And uh
D :  That's the kind what you were going for
C :  Very complicated
D :  As an l. c. d. thing which we thought could look get a bit
D :  Confusing in
D :  The expenses well first this one is got a kind of scroll
C :  Uh okay
D :  Like a mouse
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Which
C :  The the middle button
D :  Yeah
C :  Okay
D :  Um
D :  And but i'm not exactly sure how we could use that like you would do it
C :  Uh it's kinda like scrolling that
D :  Computer come
C :  That that uh fourth of of like in the right one of the same thing and from um one are you scroll it and then when you reach the sort of um
C :  Menu item that you require you pressed
D :  Oh that's like the l. c. d. one is the
C :  But all of a scroll
C :  Right okay
D :  But the one to lay that it's got like a little scroll function on the side but i presume that the functions was come up on the t. v. screen
C :  Yeah
D :  I think that's what that is so it's just a few ideas then that's that's quite boring shape great looks quite space eighty bit too many buttons i think on that one
C :  You play
C :  Yeah that's like uh it looks like so we have a "'kay"
A :  Looks threatening
D :  Yeah it does like kind of dangerous
A :  Yeah
A :  Let's say yeah okay
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Um that's what i thought was really cool it's cool it's got a program that c. function we talked about you can
D :  And in their t. k. it's and it's quite in
D :  Organic she and the little circle and that's pretty cool
C :  Yeah
D :  And that's really easy to use bright so i like this um uh for a design
D :  I think something like that would be good
C :  Yeah um i mean the one thing uh think about about these ones is um these
D :  Of course yellow
C :  The security
C :  Yes
C :  And
C :  I've seen a lot of them with uh the cover missing
D :  Right yeah
C :  So like other hand show them so clip-on or whatever
D :  Yeah that's true yeah
D :  Um so maybe that could be
D :  Built into one things and it comes up on the t. v. or something
D :  And this one big oversized one
D :  I don't know about you but
D :  I think it's a bit too gimmick i don't think
A :  Mm
C :  Yeah
D :  That will that sell very well
C :  I mean is that not so if this is the blink or something isn't
D :  I guess so i don't know
D :  I think that's a bit
A :  I don't do it a point to watch t. v.
C :  Strange
D :  If i thought it is it
C :  Other day
C :  They they listen to it
A :  They do
D :  Yeah yeah
D :  And um this one
D :  It's just pointing out i like that
D :  Some of these things um the the raised symbols everything but it's pointing out
D :  Um that
D :  This one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape so that could that's a bit confusing
C :  Right okay
D :  Um but the buttons on this i think
D :  Odd it's just a ring you how you can have different
D :  Different um buttons don't feel the same
D :  That's quite cool um
C :  The people tend to recognise uh shapes to do certain things and
D :  Yeah exactly
D :  Um
D :  F. five
D :  So there so the findings so we need to combine those ones
D :  Um and i just got
D :  An email from uh
D :  Technical department
D :  Saying that they have
D :  Broken three would certainly speech recognition software that you can programme and
C :  And and
C :  Handy
D :  Um yeah i was just in time very handy
C :  I
D :  And so it
D :  I think maybe incorporating that in a sign would be good just you program it
D :  Like you say you record
D :  Um and then play you and then the court
D :  The time she and stuff like that so that's
D :  And as much
D :  Yeah
D :  That's quite cool
D :  Uh personal preference is just a imagination the race symbols little good
D :  The l. c. d. it doesn't make small but i think maybe for all up but uh it do you think that would be a bit too
D :  Expensive to have the
A :  The l. c. d.
D :  Yeah
A :  And the other stuff that i think
D :  And the speech recognition setting would actually going for speech recognition a way
B :  Right you know a market survey we have seen that people are we doing to be able to what they want the choir do they want a fancy look they want some new design something new
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Um but uh but uh
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  It's still still got to get button
D :  We've yeah
B :  Yeah so even if we increase the work was a little bit
B :  But you know some remotes and we give something new technology got are the ones where and as well as
A :  I
B :  New design it fancy outlook
D :  Uh-huh
B :  I think we really need the requirements and we will be able to
B :  Have a good sales
D :  Okay
B :  In the market
D :  I'm not sure if that it
A :  Yeah but that
D :  Twenty five euros a cat or twelve years fifteen manufacturing cost of thing that might
C :  I can sit although i mean today to be
D :  The l. c. d.
C :  Sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l. c. d. technology notes of that
C :  You've got your l. c. d. t. v.s and everything so maybe the small
D :  Yeah
C :  But i mean like a light up
C :  Black and white
C :  I guess it just doesn't like funky stuff
D :  No
C :  And part
C :  I mean like
C :  Even mobile phones whatever have that colour l. c. d. screens
D :  Yeah
C :  I mean i would know about the cost of them
D :  Oh
A :  But uh price and price not withstanding um
B :  And in the
B :  Uh
A :  Is it too complicated it's it can be too much just overload
B :  Ah
D :  Yeah that's the thing because
B :  It will be easy because there will be on l. c. d. c. is i mean there were different different than "'cause" they can just critical cool okay whatever the war
A :  The thing is
A :  When use remote control you never look at it right
C :  Yeah
A :  You look and he and
D :  Yeah
D :  That's true yeah
A :  And it's uh it just seems kind of like uh
D :  And one of the survey findings was that they want to easy to use a i think i'm not sure about the l. c. d. it it it's quite a good idea but for but there and for that
A :  I need this
D :  The thing we tried before easy easy to use it's not
D :  The thing which before i think
D :  Charge friends i thought this as good as you pointed out the um
D :  The bit
D :  It often goes missing especially the children it's a good shape and the organic is kind of
D :  We could make of
D :  Vegetable you kind of round shape i think
A :  So which actual
C :  Yeah i reckon
D :  Yeah i know carets i
C :  Yeah well so since we're going for the uh but those are the company colours i think the lemon wasn't that far
A :  Would allow the order that
D :  Yeah
C :  I have it doesn't work you know we just made a lemon
D :  Well we don't want it to be
D :  Yeah
D :  And the child friendly at
D :  Easy to use it seems quite easy to like at the different shapes of the buttons and stuff i think that's a good idea to control
C :  Uh-huh
C :  I like i like the colour for buttons as well
D :  Yeah and the mouse one i thought it was a good idea because people use mile mice mouse is now with the scrolling thing
D :  Um
C :  I mean we are marketing to sort of
C :  For five to thirty five so most people
D :  Yeah
C :  We'll have come in contact with that
D :  Yeah
C :  Use
D :  So there'd be able to use that and as i said i think it up she would come up on the screen
C :  Yeah
D :  Um so we
D :  They've got
C :  And that means that that means you get the bomb that that to the t. v. makers
A :  Yeah
D :  Say that's um
D :  They user interface
D :  It's nine
D :  Okay take this out uh
A :  Um
D :  Okay okay
A :  So
C :  Just it's
A :  I guess there are a lot of options are gonna have to choose from one
C :  Yeah looks like it
A :  Yeah well
A :  I'll give you the uh
A :  I guess
A :  Technical considerations for those
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And then use the whiteboard is "'cause" we haven't used it
C :  Yeah i was just thinking the self same thing
A :  Right so
A :  When do this
A :  Is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
A :  Well reuse that the final kind of
B :  Uh
A :  Um essential pieces of it
A :  And then we'll throw in our new innovations
A :  Keep rolling budget
A :  So uh
C :  Magic
A :  Yeah looking inside a a very simple remote control
A :  That's what they sent me
A :  "'kay" here's uh the competition i suppose
A :  Um you open up there's a circuit board inside
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  And there's a chip
A :  Costs are the t. a. one one eight three five which
A :  Um are see the input from the buttons
C :  So is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
A :  Right it's very very cheap remote this remote
A :  Course not
A :  Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates into the sequence of courses that it
A :  And sends to
A :  The amplifier which is made of some transistors and
A :  Amplifiers
A :  Are times
A :  And then i get sent to the uh
B :  Mm
A :  The l. e. d. light
A :  Which uh you can
A :  I see the little red light bulb at the end
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Right
A :  And that
A :  Sends out the infrared
A :  Uh lights signal
A :  To the television
A :  Yes
A :  Um so this is kind i. d.
A :  The bare essentials that we need to have a remote control because it it defines the uh
C :  Okay
C :  So can we make them to promote any size we like or is there a minimum
A :  Oh um now i'm in this very old one so now the new technology this as uh a man we small and
C :  The gonna be
A :  Cheap thing to me
C :  Almost a key thing
A :  Right so this is what we need to have
A :  For certain
A :  Um
A :  Sorry necessary at the outer casing which you have to decide you know what's gonna be
A :  On the board we have to use b. c.
C :  Oh
A :  At the same setup
A :  Processor are more plays a more
A :  Against process and i had
A :  And find transmitter a standard
A :  Um so for the casing
A :  Uh this email i got
A :  From our manufacturing team
A :  Ah you know we have a bunch of options from
A :  Would it
A :  Titanium rubber plastic
A :  What not
A :  Um latex
A :  Double curved curved
A :  So what stress is what we think
A :  But we're sponge i guess is it on there
C :  Well
D :  Mm
C :  Well i mean like play-doh latex as a kinda spongy feel to it doesn't it um
D :  I'm not sure about sponge
A :  Uh is very plasticky for sure
C :  Yeah and that would call significant durability and
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  Um
C :  And that's also if it's a relatively cheap to cast
A :  Uh-huh so
C :  Um
C :  So the base that sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex can she
A :  Okay so i hear uh a plastic
A :  Uh latex
D :  I like the rubber it be
D :  Stress balls i think you know with that could be a bit of a kinetic like is
C :  Right okay
A :  Alright
C :  I don't know what that stuff is
D :  Good to hold on
A :  So something with give two
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  And that might be quite durable and easy to talk around
A :  And
A :  And the colours yellow right
D :  Yeah
C :  Or at least incorporating
D :  Yellow incorporated yeah
A :  Um
C :  I mean i forgot it would serve
C :  Uhuh
C :  I dunno other
D :  I think
C :  It's kind of silver kind of
D :  Hmm
C :  Other parts or uh
D :  Yeah the buttons like "'cause"
D :  It's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons and property two different colours or it if we having buttons actually
C :  Uh-huh
A :  So yellow
D :  I dunno
C :  Um
A :  The body
A :  And then we'll colour for the buttons
C :  Um i quite like them all the colour buttons or so
D :  Yeah
A :  So multicoloured but
D :  You do have ones like um playing could be green or on and off as reds and stuff like that yeah
C :  Yeah or yellow or uh maybe even just alone italy colour so it it doesn't work too
D :  Makes it easy to use
C :  Childish
D :  Yeah that's true because that do we want it like
C :  Yeah i
D :  Quite often
C :  Well i mean there's uh also comes to shape as well i mean if we are going to
C :  We can of all i mean double curved send it to me
C :  If we're talking about three or can we can easy use
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm yeah
C :  The be comfy a you know
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah so
A :  The shape
A :  I wanna go
A :  Um
A :  How exactly maybe
D :  Like a
D :  Uh an hour glass half ago so we're thinking of for just like it
C :  Do that so yeah that that they that's sort of
C :  Comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it
D :  It's not
A :  What about a banana
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  I
D :  We could make novelty remote controls
C :  Well yeah i mean like
A :  I'd we're gonna have a big banana shaped remote control "'cause" yellow
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  And a lemon might be a little hard to great
B :  Um
D :  I would you point to
B :  Ah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah uh-huh
D :  How would you point to it what
A :  Oh it it doesn't matter which any point i guess we could have a lot leds in each and
C :  There we go
B :  Yeah
D :  Oh
C :  Pennies
B :  Yeah i appreciate this idea because then this uh huh
C :  I
B :  Yeah they say that it was in our everyday is windows and we can uh a lady that fruit and veg a day was to be process is that what they were data shows that
D :  Yeah
B :  So this
D :  Why d. o. on a show rather than an idea
B :  So
C :  Yeah
B :  Mm
C :  I it it
A :  So spongy
C :  Um
D :  Rubber don't know
A :  Banana
C :  I mean uh it it's it's
D :  I
D :  Oh o. k. a.
C :  Does it does seem to but uh i can tell that should be
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay okay
D :  I think maybe just to roll on the kind of
D :  Fruit and vegetables shape them
D :  What else as you say about fashion thought was trendy
B :  Uh the fashion their show that fruit and veggie there was a people uh i dunno
C :  And do this
D :  And spongy yeah
A :  So maybe in an unidentified all fruit or
B :  Spongy and uh
D :  Yeah
A :  If i will fruit or vegetable like
D :  Yeah
A :  So i have a stem perhaps
A :  And uh
D :  Maybe yeah
A :  It is
C :  Yeah
D :  Like what's what's that i think in a the name of a some kind of you know it's like look like los name and kind of thing
A :  Actually symmetric
D :  I don't know the name of that
A :  So it look like this can
D :  Yeah that's i was thinking
A :  I get bored
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah that that so yeah
B :  Oh
A :  Squash
D :  "'cause" that you can hold it in like boston bit and
A :  And as a a clear top and bottom sense you could say you know transmits from this and
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah well no more but i
D :  I don't know what the u. k. it would you think
C :  That'll make is fifty million euros
C :  Um
C :  Well i guess it canada i don't know so we have to have it
C :  Sort of clearly identified as a fruit just have that kind of fruit a shape
D :  No
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah the normally we can relate to
C :  Yeah but related by advertising or
B :  Something
B :  Yeah
B :  Exactly
A :  So double curved
A :  Single curved with you
C :  Yeah uh
B :  Well we can do something we can designed to to shave then we can have a public some of the led to probably choose what they want
D :  Oh
C :  That's a good man there's a good idea
D :  Okay
A :  Okay um i guess since you're the marketing uh
B :  Yeah sure i will be happy to do that
A :  You could do that
A :  Um
D :  Okay
D :  I'm buttons would do we stay
D :  Uh different shape
D :  What buttons
C :  Um uh the best way for a specific functions you know all the time
C :  Uhuh
D :  Mm
C :  Play stop
C :  They've got a minute "'cause" standard sort of intuitive uh um
A :  So button
C :  Things are always used
D :  And the
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  It's like that
D :  Yeah
C :  But i i like it um mm
A :  With the scroll wheel or no
D :  Yeah what about a scroll wheel
D :  Speech recognition
C :  Uh speech recognition i think so we need a microphone reasonably
A :  We could put the microphone
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah there's microphone
C :  Yeah
A :  Where chip
C :  I mean at at uh what are we sure the scroll wheel does give ease of use
D :  Yeah i'm not sure um
D :  Um
D :  I mean those ideas i so would just for inspiration i think
C :  But we're not doing this for you
D :  Um
D :  Yeah i can
D :  Mm sure
A :  Okay well we can do some user tested scroll-wheels yeah
D :  I couldn't
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  And uh i think if this this you software for the same recognition is that you keep on keep in the microphone
D :  Yeah
A :  So should microphone be does anyone on it or
C :  I would put it it's sort of substantially so it's yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  That's right
C :  So it can be sort of held and
D :  That's cool
C :  Um
C :  We really need really gonna need to hold it
C :  If it's gonna be voice recognition
A :  Um now all we can
C :  "'s" i i i i
D :  I
A :  Um
C :  Uh
D :  So i was use the whiteboard anymore i
C :  I
D :  I
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
C :  But i
B :  Yeah
C :  Oops easy
C :  Yes
A :  So i i
D :  And as to what else was uh um
B :  Right
D :  The
D :  What about the glow in the dark think the strip around that we just need that
C :  I was uh i still like it but um
D :  It's ah okay
C :  But that's me
D :  "'cause" we've got the
D :  Uh it technological innovation with the speech
D :  Recognition system
C :  Yeah so maybe it's just gonna bit too far i mean we are pushing it probably bit funny fruitshaped
D :  "'cause" "'em" pick it
D :  Yeah
C :  Um the wanna sort of overkill
D :  Especially we can i
B :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
C :  "'cause" i mean like uh uh uh for it i mean how good is a speech recognition thing do we want to go for buttons at all do we want to just have
C :  A device that maybe sets and pretend it's a fruit
D :  Beep that the fruit bowl
A :  Yeah it
C :  Yeah you know and then you just saw i mean like everybody's got a fruit bowl from the telly
A :  They can work from uh you don't have to hold it
D :  Uh-huh
C :  I
D :  Yeah yeah yeah
C :  Um
A :  It could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers
D :  Yeah
C :  Hmm
C :  We can make them think of fruit yeah
A :  Fruits all around them
B :  Yeah
A :  As a nation we do need the remote
C :  I mean uh
D :  Yeah do we need buttons
C :  Some of that like think of a fruit that could sit sit and then we and so on like care
C :  I do an apple
D :  Mm
C :  It's just apple's sort of
C :  Yeah you know apple "'s" or mm
D :  I quite like the shape i quite like the design of that
C :  I i
D :  "'cause" that could sit on a say in that and
C :  Yeah
D :  It's quite got a quite a steady pace
C :  Okay yeah that's good
C :  Really
D :  Um
A :  Oh yeah
D :  And does it say we need we do wanna be too meticulous with the fruit things yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  But yeah but the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held a closed you can set a distance
D :  Right
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah so i mean like you could actually
C :  Yeah gives you the options
B :  Are we can we can do one thing mm
B :  We can just have a remote control
B :  And casings of different different shapes different fruit shape so in such a way that any giving can you could be fit into this
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Well way to do the please so whatever people want like if somebody wanted in banana shaped we will put that casing
D :  Uh-huh
B :  On to that war waveform okay it will look or
C :  So a selection of casing
B :  And yeah in that that
D :  Yeah "'cause" you said about this baseball to me
C :  Can affect if this was first the marketing um
B :  So it's a sunday
D :  You said about the space ball other people wants baseball things say
B :  Uh like if this is um like if this is a mobile phone
D :  Could do that like um a choice
B :  Uh uh we're gonna design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour okay is somebody wants it to in banana shape realistic banana shaped giving want to that so it will give a banana shape look if somebody wanted a nap but if we were designed that even put
D :  Yeah
C :  Like a like a mouse uh-huh
D :  Yeah
B :  We will put up a shape casing on that you do your apple-shaped look so in that they
D :  Okay
C :  Mm "'kay"
B :  You can have any um is whatever you want
D :  Okay we still
B :  Without uh yeah
D :  Need the buttons in the same place is that anyway
B :  Yeah but it may be on the opposite oh what does it mean the on the upper side
C :  You can standardise those i mean
D :  Uh that's the other side uh okay
B :  Yeah but that's only on the upper side or side we will just put a t. k. think so half of that will be look be
D :  Aha for for it oh okay okay
B :  Yeah i'm not a one or the upper side so from lower you can you mean slide you are holding off on the side you can you can have a banana look all apple look what they were saying that they would need not to do uh i have different of a chip more lights everything we we just design key rings
D :  Okay yeah okay
B :  Fruit shape
D :  Okay
C :  I think the i think if you're gonna have uh five sure then you want to have it so that it does go for the buttons "'cause" i mean if you think about it
B :  And uh
C :  If they're wanting it "'cause" they want to look at it if they using it
C :  And what they wanna look at is facing we from them
D :  Mm
C :  It doesn't really
D :  Mm
C :  You know "'cause" that'd be in the palm of the hand them and they will see it
D :  Yeah
C :  Unless you have sort of
C :  You got the buttons option one sorry
C :  You get the fashion on the other side with the microphones so you can place it face time
C :  And you've got the fashion or
C :  And you can just talk at all
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Okay
C :  I i
A :  Okay um so
C :  I see you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options
A :  Yeah so
A :  I guess you decide on material right
A :  So that that's spongy latex rubber
D :  Yeah
A :  Everything
B :  Uh-huh
A :  And the colours we got them
D :  Yeah
A :  And the shape they will just make it kind of mixed and matched type shape or
D :  Well i mean because
D :  All i i'm not sure if we should go say for the whole freaking because i think we should maybe just taking inspiration from the free
D :  And and because
C :  Okay so we stick with what we've got there
D :  Would you yeah well i think the wheel would
D :  We're trying to get twenty five thirty five euros want to quite trendy as well they said
D :  They want something that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick that something economically
D :  Shape and
D :  Organic like it to hold
D :  Based on fruits and natural things like that
C :  Okay
D :  Because all already we're going a bit
D :  Court t. with the yeah then you know
C :  Uh-huh
D :  I mean we could make a nice pale yeah i know
C :  Well it's kind of got be are companies you know
D :  Okay
D :  Okay
C :  So again i mean like we could have uh i mean we could quite easily have the the main body be different
D :  Yeah maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside date
C :  Colour but i have
D :  Bright yellow he would set the logo and the slogan
C :  Kinda go online okay
D :  Because
C :  Um i mean they even have i mean not necessarily that the um
C :  The whole body has to be of the company colours so
D :  Yeah
C :  You know and all in yellow tend to go to well well together c. r.s main body blue with the yellow
C :  Logo and
C :  Slogan running up one side of it kind of thing
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um as for the energy source
A :  Um
A :  Almost every remote control is just batteries but
A :  We'll have to be limited by that you can use a hand dynamo
A :  Um i'm not planning to crank it
C :  Uh that's i think is basically the more you move it it
C :  It's got we thing inside it just can no
A :  Right it's like those watches the
C :  Powers it
C :  Yeah
A :  This might be a gift or something that people we wanna grab it
D :  All it is dynamo
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Shake it if it's an
D :  Yeah
B :  Mm
C :  I
D :  Yeah like with those watches be kind of test yeah
C :  I like that yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay so if it if it's not working
C :  Okay
B :  But uh
D :  That's quite cool
C :  You shake it in screen uh huh
A :  I guess people's natural reaction anyways to to shake the thing
C :  Yeah
B :  But
D :  Yeah there's yeah
B :  Where do you think that it will be a good idea to you then i will
B :  Then these table so she was then people have to uh like in the cell is out of the time
C :  Does leave them alone obligation to
B :  Yeah i don't know
C :  Especially if you want to use it is uh specifically as um voice activated then
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah because most of the people
D :  Yeah
D :  And they have to pick it up and then activate and then yeah
B :  Mm yeah
C :  Okay okay
D :  That's true
C :  Right um what other options
A :  Other solar power
B :  Uh sort of our then also i'm not to be a good idea but then they have to keep them and they are more whites outside the solar energy and d. day then there is no solar satellite
C :  Um well right and i think you know i've got i've got no i've gotten a face enhances or whatever some coming in my one
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  But i just
B :  What do we
B :  Well yeah i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea they can
D :  But we like just a normal light
C :  And through
C :  I mean i i know that that idea that i thought oh
B :  They can recharge it yeah
C :  Um
C :  Just on the basis of like reading room of batteries and that kind of all there is having a
D :  And we're very of r. n. c. trendy company out with so
C :  Yeah having a rechargeable stand so that not only it doubles as a standard part
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  And for using it as a a recharging of also for using it as send recognition
D :  Yeah
D :  Like like a hand like what is portable phones
C :  Yeah that kind of thing
D :  Kind of thing
B :  Yeah that's true yeah exactly
A :  So uh rechargeable battery
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  The user interface the buttons
A :  I guess we talked about this right
D :  Mm
C :  It was chip on print what's
A :  Um
C :  So i am i
A :  The uh electronics um basically the more features we add
A :  Um
A :  So more
A :  Features we had the
A :  Fancy chips we need to buy
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And put in
A :  Which adds to the cost
D :  Uh-huh
A :  You can expect
A :  Um
A :  But uh
A :  I think we can keep it all under budget
A :  So uh
A :  Yeah so the speech thing you said are
A :  Or take now our research and development department came up with some breakthrough
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So
C :  Yeah and if we're if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting are cheapest option of
D :  Just in time
A :  Just in time
C :  J. peg
A :  Right right
C :  That's good at all okay we're we're kind of uh
A :  Keep the l. c. d. screen out
