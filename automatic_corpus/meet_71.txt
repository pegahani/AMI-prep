C :  Mm
C :  Okay
C :  I have
D :  Mm
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  A little v.
D :  Yes and no okay
C :  Uh-huh
D :  From here
D :  No for that
C :  Uh-huh if that's
A :  All set
A :  Cool
A :  Or right it is powerpoint time
C :  Uh-huh
A :  At the more powerpoints in this particular experiment then
C :  Uh-huh
A :  I've never done in my life for this curve
B :  Yeah
B :  I
A :  It's kind of uh
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Mm
A :  To sell out here we have our detailed design meeting and we're we will um
A :  Look at the prototype be and um
A :  Right so um
A :  I finally figured out what this whole second board point is about them i got my coat a cemetery you need some supposed to read the minutes from previous meeting
B :  Oh really okay
A :  I think
D :  How
A :  I don't know
A :  Otherwise it's just saying and the secretary and and
A :  They're from taking minutes so so just to go um or uh or just real briefly go over minutes from last meeting uh we'll open it up slowly
A :  No
A :  Wait for it
A :  Wait for it
A :  To
A :  Which i
D :  Yeah that's uh you
A :  No that's handy okay
D :  I
B :  I
A :  This is this is a very
A :  High powered stuff it to look like a
A :  There we go
A :  So um basically the more the start from a last minute uh uh last meeting was that
A :  Um we
A :  That we had meetings from that we had presentations them by the industrial designer will from a friend there on the kind of sarah about what we can do here
A :  Um and white
A :  Sort of limitations were operating with um as you know it uses were operating under
A :  What kind of a risk would be looking at what some of the various bridges we're discussing and we essentially in the conclusion that we should
A :  Develop a remote with their voice recognition either have a clean on remote like shape um because you can really use it as remotes as you could use a voice
A :  I would include some mostly just a simple design features for television operation
A :  But with uh a slider for that day for more advanced functions for users
A :  Um and that the uh
A :  At the u. i. d. in the i. d. were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press a look at
A :  So i
A :  That's sort of like the main
A :  Me here um
A :  Go ahead and take away yes
B :  Well um
B :  We have a sample our prototype um
B :  What's we said about it
B :  Um
B :  We take into account lot of things that we went over and the last meeting um
B :  So the most important things to consider or that it's
B :  We decided not to go for a touch screen which can say
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And a p. for some very
B :  Large buttons for the
B :  Primary functions
B :  Um
B :  This is going to be the on off button and then we have
B :  These points to go through the channels um and then to volume buttons down here
B :  That was so those are the most important
B :  I buttons
B :  And then
B :  Pretty more advanced uh functions there's a slight out
B :  Panel here
B :  Um
B :  You can see that there are lots of things going on
B :  But is actually can slide back and
B :  Fried spray
B :  Nice a static one it's a put away
B :  Um
B :  It's four is the uh for the small white thing we decided to go with that
C :  Yeah
D :  Ah
B :  Multiple colours coming out why not
A :  Nice
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
D :  Fair enough
C :  Mm
B :  Of course if that's annoying for some people uh function can be turned off
A :  Perfect
B :  Um
C :  No it it's important to be we talked a quite a bit about uh you know that they interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural it here uh
B :  Right
D :  Hmm
D :  Right
C :  No we caught fruity if you
B :  Yeah
D :  Appropriate okay
C :  Huh
C :  Right um of course that's that you change one that i think it would be desirable for the uh
C :  For the regular product in the in the in the
C :  In the first packaging could be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done
D :  It is an option
C :  Um and as you can see on the television there
C :  Now we have the uh voice detector device
A :  Oh right
C :  Ah
C :  On the top there
B :  What's this here
D :  Uh
A :  I
C :  Ah
D :  I see
C :  So that that will work way well with with regard to find in this uh contraption
C :  Um what other things we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel
C :  Um so i think that will work well uh with regards to our market
A :  Mm
C :  Um mm
C :  And uh mm
C :  Let's see well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and one on available
C :  Um
C :  But you have anything else to add to that
B :  Um
B :  Uh worry about the materials it is
B :  Uh entire thing is covered and uh rubber coating
B :  So it's very durable
B :  Uh it's like an it
B :  Break like sometimes a plastic straps
B :  Um and of course as you can see if you touch it does have a nice squishy feel
C :  It's actually important to know that the television uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that
C :  The it it actually is edible inside
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Fact or if you notice but i wrote yeah
B :  Company's name
A :  Uh well well then yeah
B :  Oh yeah that's nice
D :  Yeah yes
A :  Uh huh
B :  This is actually
B :  Yeah up on the inside
C :  Mm
D :  Do we need to worry about um brought factors
C :  Um huh
C :  It's in case in a newer to uh huh
D :  Okay that's sort of the moment worry
C :  Colour yeah that's fine
B :  Yeah we got to have ourselves a know we're not talking about making televisions this point or anything like that but it's
D :  Okay
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Fair enough
A :  I have a sense that so if if the future
D :  No but
A :  Yeah
D :  It's a couple years off at least
C :  Plus
C :  A possible new product
D :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  But i think that's i think that sums up the main features of uh of the remote um i don't know if you guys have any questions or what is that uh whether we need to worry about any uh either marketing areas or anything of that
A :  Right
B :  Right
C :  Make sure um did we come in under budget
B :  I would say yeah this costs well to put this into um production
B :  Working abouts
B :  Was our uh coast twelve fifty euro
B :  Um and this guy actually can do it that all of a ninety nine
B :  Um
B :  So it's quite pleased with that
C :  Uh-huh
B :  One thing that we didn't see a lot um
B :  What is we have a choice with the buttons well as you scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just went for a classic
B :  Rubber button
B :  And um
B :  It's as we did that we do have to use as many microchips which is quite nice and that's what how keep the cost down
A :  Right
B :  See the has a lot of
B :  Modern technology
B :  Um for example the voice recognition always just a simple
B :  Remote
B :  Damn
B :  I think
B :  If we shopped around from
B :  Other manufacturers
B :  Um we might be able to
B :  Did you can cheaper
B :  And
C :  Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option
B :  Oh no we haven't talked but they have a
C :  So uh uh
C :  So uh yeah on the back you'll notice this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh
D :  Okay
C :  Uh a console
C :  And uh
C :  I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall work
C :  Um but but basically the voice recognition that uh incorporates um the latest designs are they researching this you know the couple come up with basically uh quite so what are the coffee maker
C :  Uh design that we're talking about it and
C :  Uh i think that uh i was given a proven
C :  Um
C :  Ease of use and whatnot
B :  Yeah
C :  And uh allows features
C :  Like
C :  The remote actually talking back to the user
D :  Mm
C :  Huh
C :  So
A :  Cool
B :  Any questions
A :  No no i think that's
D :  Do we have um other
D :  Five other words games covers
C :  Uh-huh
D :  In plain our those gonna be developed later once we see how to cut we have goal or
B :  Um
B :  Do let's just when you i mean that's true
D :  Do we know we stay in on that yeah
C :  Well we didn't quite have enough material uh-huh
D :  Oh i was exciting approximation of you guys had in mind yet
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Oh i see
C :  Right um
B :  Um
B :  Well as you can see this is just the most superficial where
B :  And um
B :  Be very easy to
D :  Okay
B :  Puts know where
D :  Just
B :  Have something else like
D :  Then you're really yeah
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Right actually this bottom or red green here just on clips and then you put uh a new a new uh
D :  Okay
D :  And the whole thing
D :  Okay
C :  And you played on top of that so uh i mean there are i i we we definitely for a start uh a spongy even spongy or
D :  Right
D :  Yeah
C :  Non actual work uh materials which i think we're go find we also continue down with the ideas that well following a apples colour schemes with a kind of the uh later orange and green or
D :  Okay
D :  Okay
D :  Okay cool
B :  It's not
B :  It's a quite a a faceplate it's more like a serial faceplate
D :  Okay
B :  Because
B :  It simple enough that
B :  In the factory a kid
B :  We could very easily put it on on it it works in a place such that
B :  Yeah it's pretty
B :  Permanent
B :  The same time
B :  If we wanna go the other way is just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the faceplate life you know there any
D :  Okay
D :  Yep
D :  Its own option we
B :  Yeah
D :  You get very cool
D :  To start
A :  I hear things guess that's very very good were like it
A :  Right
A :  Um
A :  What we need to discuss now is to find it so that uh might that mean you've got
A :  You find in a number that actually sounds quite nice um
A :  That troubles i was just given this by fine it's um it's a spreadsheet of the parts and then i've just
B :  Yeah
A :  Tentatively put in what it's going to look like
A :  Um it's gonna clear this out we'll quickly
A :  But it looks like
A :  So we just if we can just itemise what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
B :  Right so we will it touch on that but
A :  With the back of battery
B :  It it's in there yep
A :  With the back okay
A :  Um and
C :  The voice recognition yeah yeah actually doubles as uh
C :  As the solar cell or
A :  Clever clever well then
A :  Um so i guess that would mean we've got to have a um
A :  It's a it's a speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it
B :  Yeah
B :  She's making use the same space and send it to use but
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
A :  Um in the case it's more of a a single curved case i guess to be that the general
B :  Yeah one big curve stick to
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um oh we've got our rubber ski and material basically throughout
A :  Um
A :  Pushbutton interface
A :  Um with this other crap know so maybe we get to push button interface is that right
B :  Yeah hmmm
A :  Um
A :  And um special
A :  I guess is a look at at throw wood material or rubbery tight material
B :  Yeah special
A :  Throughout yeah
B :  And so i guess you have to mark special colour special form as well
B :  And she is it is very unconventional
A :  Yeah it's it's quite unique i like it yes
B :  Oh i think as an control
C :  Mm hmm hmm
A :  So it looks like
D :  Oh come in at sixteen
A :  A bit over budget
B :  Oh
A :  Um
B :  So much at this
C :  Uh-huh
A :  So what we could do perhaps
A :  A simple fix it maybe to switch away from the solar cells
A :  Um or take out the back up battery
B :  He's about that
C :  I mean i i think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features being incremental and without that is in one uh although it does still have the battery so i'm not sure that
C :  Know what the cell is on that
B :  I mean we could take
B :  We could take the battery at it you see any probably work ninety nine percent of time but
B :  You have to set up a call centre for that one percent the time people are lines at work
C :  Mm mm
B :  My remote is working what am i gonna do
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm
A :  Uh-huh
B :  People groups that
B :  I think the long run it's better to keep the battery
D :  Sure
B :  It's hard to scrap the whole solar battery idea "'cause" that's
B :  So entitled to
B :  The thing that we have
A :  Mm hmm
A :  What's difficult we have all these things integral to the um
A :  To the design of it that we just can't back out of now i would have to be
A :  Seems like we have to go back to
A :  Square one
A :  In a way
A :  Um if we're gonna try to
A :  And do when they would probably have to india master
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
D :  Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental
D :  I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way were marking this is like a natural new
D :  Thing
D :  But honestly if we cut that one piece our actually coming under budget if at the moment correctly
C :  We might be all this way beyond idea that
D :  I mean
C :  We are main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that's what's that's a subway right
D :  Which it's
D :  Yeah that's what setting us into this young market
C :  Uh
D :  Minutes or we started from so
D :  I don't know i mean it you know perhaps when this uh technology comes down price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that maybe at a bar we could
C :  In reality as you know for me from an ideological sense but i don't like to stick with the uh
C :  The solar cell but
C :  A hack kind of have to throw myself in the in that this is structure and model here
D :  Hmm
D :  Yeah
C :  And uh
B :  Right
C :  Yeah i think
A :  The t. v. or
C :  I think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project
D :  Yeah
C :  Without the solar cell
B :  Yeah
D :  I think that for sure that's our best option
B :  He's uh to do that
B :  So we were gonna get blow
B :  Uh calls and
D :  Hmm
B :  Twelve fifty
A :  "'cause" we can remove the pushbuttons "'cause" they are out there
B :  Yeah huh
D :  He kind
A :  Um
D :  Yeah
A :  Or we can get rid of the uh i mean
A :  Removing the
A :  "'kay" in the case wouldn't be so much of a
C :  Save it
A :  Mm
A :  Um no we change in the case materials
D :  Hmm mm
A :  Um
A :  See a that looks like to be the only fair
D :  Yeah
A :  So that would be it to me to change but
A :  Yeah
B :  Can we do a good idea
A :  Alright so our agreement on that
D :  Unfortunately i think we are
C :  I think that's a good compromise you got four it's a
A :  Right
A :  Moving along swiftly um so i guess no we just go to
A :  Be project evaluation
A :  Which i will allow
A :  Senator gore
D :  They'll be mean
D :  Um cord
A :  Oh of course sorry
D :  No problem
D :  You reach that would be great think yeah
A :  Think that it it grey
C :  Uh-huh
D :  I really do that on purpose either
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay i'll basically i was just evaluating um
D :  From what we know of our product for t. may now with the criteria that we said the beginning of these are things we need to use the things that look like we feel are important
D :  Um so i was looking at basic design things does it fulfil its function as a remote is the design what we want it to you are technologies up to where we hope they would be and is a fully ecstatic well these that are we sure market research was looking for
D :  Um
D :  Basic questions like you know does that are no no
D :  Doesn't respond the voice recognition
D :  And overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par um the only thing is with with the poll up here all day is to take some adjusting because in user interface
D :  Um
D :  Data
D :  Look like it was coming up rough but then once you get used to it does make a sense so i think overall we're having the right direction
B :  Really good
D :  So
C :  They like that spongy feel
D :  Yeah
B :  Uh huh
D :  It looks like it's going also
C :  And the paging function works well that's good do here
B :  Six
D :  Where
D :  Very good yeah
C :  We were trying on that one
B :  We did
D :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  It's i think eventually if we do um brainchild is partly we do have a higher better option than if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from all the rooms the house of stuff but for now what we've got is working in the range we afford so
D :  Target
A :  Right
B :  And at this point about losing the solar panel
D :  That's everything for me
B :  But it's okay
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah it is a setback but
D :  Okay you could back
C :  We might've yeah
A :  Um yeah we just one
C :  We might have lost like green or make it again but we are
B :  Right now
A :  Well i don't know it's like it
C :  Uh i guess that's true
B :  Sure
A :  Right so um
A :  This one's a bit and clear to me to be perfectly fair um
A :  Pick up the slide
A :  From the coach
A :  And i'm not sure what is connected to um so i guess we are going to discuss
A :  Um
B :  I
A :  Yeah i project process um
D :  Uh huh
B :  Oh
A :  And that is going to go into my report so i guess this is the point where we go um
A :  Uh i would
A :  Overall it looks like and talk about
A :  Or satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and
B :  Okay
A :  I dunno work i guess um
D :  As in within the team or
A :  I think so yeah
B :  Right so it's just kind of that
D :  Okay
A :  I think it's
B :  Open mike kind of thing
A :  Mm i think so
A :  I think
D :  It is now
D :  You're in charge so there you go i
C :  I
A :  I
A :  I'm the screen at that experience
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Because if you don't if i wanna say okay fair enough
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Or whatever
A :  Um
A :  Right
A :  Um
A :  So any thoughts
B :  We can say these points here
A :  Yeah
B :  Okay
D :  And they're starting blocks yeah
A :  But you guys feel about the process
B :  This
D :  Um you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we had to hear from the list of reproductive considering the little amount of input we had going in
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Um and the technology is to have we been hope it's really really interesting the trial this new stuff
C :  We didn't use the whiteboard well
B :  No
A :  No old know whiteboard
D :  You know we didn't
D :  We could now if you had for that really
A :  I
C :  And
D :  And if it if you guys been designing in here perhaps than to change but because of form constraints doesn't really matter
C :  I am also
C :  Had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think it would be used it at all
C :  I mean right barely anything
D :  Yeah i think they're seeking uh notes more often than usual is "'cause" i like that and yeah
B :  Yeah that's true
C :  Uh
A :  Was pretty cool textile
D :  Mm
B :  That one
D :  I am disappointed in can go back to my personal coach
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Is your a personal coach
D :  Yeah i think there's a
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  It's a lot of
B :  Yeah
D :  I see
B :  What if you response or three months from now
A :  But
D :  Okay that would be kinda creepy
B :  Happy we eighty
A :  It attempts to contact coach i did
B :  Mm hm
C :  Uh-huh
B :  I
D :  Well what kind of coaching is that really whatever really need it okay
C :  Mm
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  So i i think there's a lot of room for creativity we could do you ever basically we want in till that
D :  I think so
C :  But you came down on us
C :  Um
D :  And even then we did get a decent product or no although it's not everything we wanted it to be
B :  Yeah
C :  With the natural okay
D :  I
A :  Very natural
D :  Organic rid of it
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Does that help get people are in here is
D :  I
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  And how resourceful teammates my they had was it always a plus
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah i think yeah recap that are really creative actually i mean
C :  Mm
D :  Yeah i'm impressed
C :  I think the teamwork was good as well
B :  It's proven we were wasteful we didn't we single bit of play doh we use every day
D :  Yeah yes
D :  All for that we can take yours
B :  Yeah
C :  Mm
A :  Including is there more to the colour way that or
B :  I guess
D :  I
C :  Uh-huh
B :  But one by one chris's i was that we did happen of course to work with
B :  Well i have four
D :  Yeah
B :  Was that
D :  You could it all multiple skins really have you had more colours
B :  I know it
C :  Uh
B :  Could amazing
D :  Uh well
A :  But yes think about the the the new roles
B :  Um
D :  They were good
B :  Yeah that's what kind of fun
D :  Yeah
B :  It was
B :  I think it's pretty clever "'cause" we're never able to get
B :  Too far off track
B :  Because
B :  The information came at the right time
D :  True
B :  Kind of thought and the gaps enough
B :  The same time we have enough room to kind of
B :  Just make think so
D :  Do your own
B :  Just kinda fun
D :  But if you like it the level information dropped off severely over the course of the day
B :  Yeah
D :  It may be just me but i didn't actually get him for a chip that's what it is in a lot
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Uh-huh
A :  That's true i i got a spreadsheet
D :  Nothing
D :  I mean again you know
C :  Uh-huh
D :  But keep it was it
C :  Uh-huh
D :  So yeah i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know
D :  Fill in the blanks on your own well for creativity up to
C :  Well i think that was i think those are sure a cat finding with regard to
D :  Whatever
A :  To what to do
C :  Well no but also yeah when i was reporting about what each of us to seeing as often confused as to what you're doing
D :  That was it could be much
C :  I um and then i also felt like that
B :  You know
C :  You know a lot of our discussion with sent around
C :  Specifically what my task as because i was gonna take interface function which is what the whole product was about
B :  Yeah
D :  Yes
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Um
D :  Hmmm very much so
C :  But and then in the end i think i got an m. l. that a little bit more
B :  Yeah
B :  That's fine
C :  Uh-huh which is fine
B :  The most helpful thing and of everything
B :  Was getting that uh
B :  The powerpoint slides are they put together for you
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah are you having the format itself out a lot
B :  "'cause" if we have that
B :  There so we we could got a lot done in time
D :  Very much so
A :  Cool
C :  I think your leadership was gonna get
B :  It was really yeah
A :  She said i i i g. action in common of a w. getting in the centre with that is true and again i gotta look at that way to end of it
D :  That's kind of thing though
A :  First looked into a lot
B :  It's come on
D :  You know
D :  Yeah the rest of us some structure work with so i
A :  No
C :  That's those are the first time at a canonical a row
A :  For some other than anything like the uh project project manager in a c. or as crap it's one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh huh
A :  You know
B :  Well it's different
A :  But you can stop it you can keep
A :  Be
A :  Yeah i suspect and disbelief kind of like like the raw wanna look at
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Exit for a couple moments were just got here and you we were how to how it for t. v. then after that
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  I do mystery is that we used to it i mean as soon as we got the play that
D :  I
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  If you only imagine
C :  You know the whole concept are really try to stick with the only one out the window
D :  I had a look at
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  You mean it like that's you know
C :  Possibly
A :  If it was like this or like make a remote control
A :  Or speech chip which is of speech it like this together these build speech it's like this
C :  Oh yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Still have
A :  Everybody knows
D :  Cool it
A :  I think that speech that's the only guess i like as a team work at all
B :  Yeah
D :  I think so
C :  Yeah
C :  Mm
B :  You don't
A :  Yeah i know i don't know are you guys i don't know i don't i i was just at
C :  Uh-huh
D :  No we didn't actually i mean other than my discussion meetings or wasn't it intellectual building
B :  Yeah
D :  But i feel like if this was a team production would've been
A :  That's true um
D :  Much more of the cleverer like brainstorming use the board
D :  Well this would be in six months worth of work not
A :  Yeah
D :  Three which would be the eighties
C :  I mean i think at there should be more serious about gonna brainstorm were growing or meetings as a team
B :  Yeah
D :  That's true
A :  Yeah
A :  "'cause" i'm i'm conscious of the idea of
A :  The project manager asking
A :  You have you guys feel like as a team that's a kind of like that or
D :  Yeah that is kind of
A :  But yeah
A :  Interesting
A :  It's kind of has to be with that
A :  I mean a process of
B :  Wonder why is anything about the way we got so much for that was the kids from going to the
B :  The board
A :  I don't know i i don't know if there was a right
D :  Minus the mikes and feel like getting up and down to avoid wires i was afraid of break something actually
B :  Yeah that's it "'cause" the mikes are loose and
B :  He said we get up it's
B :  It's a possibility or tripping over something or contain cold or
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Well i don't know what i would've shown on the board
D :  True but it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't know but i would have but i know that it consciously didn't
A :  Nah right
C :  I mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really need the paper for
D :  True

D :  Yeah
C :  So i mean i guess use it as as whether they are in front of me

D :  Well it looks with fashion or
D :  I know
B :  Yeah
A :  I mean this it looks like in
A :  P. d. f. format or something
B :  Usually i would do a lot more to willing to pay idea because
D :  I know i felt like an easy to be professional so i think it's for all from from a pay for itself
C :  Yeah
B :  I
D :  Okay but not entirely but still
C :  I
D :  Actually i must say he should be good
B :  Uh-huh

D :  Mm
B :  I was just rest over and then by the time like that's last slide
B :  Yeah a very much
D :  Whatever
C :  I think there's also a realisation of
C :  Basically just copy and paste words given to you and your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning
B :  Yeah
D :  Very much yeah
A :  I actually didn't do that although every single one at all the presentations i either added slides or any um

D :  And uh
A :  Mm no no
C :  Um
A :  It's like everything flowed pretty logically
B :  Oh i see
A :  You know from that
A :  The basics to the concept a look at the whole concept saying that all concepts phase i don't think i really
A :  And used to it like the concept what we had the okay to the notion of that
D :  "'cause" it's a functional item
A :  Yeah i mean it's like i have a concept um um buttons material is just
A :  It is that it's
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah maybe you rather than concepts you should be fine and we should i i thought i thought a rather than ten seconds that i thought of it in terms of um
A :  Like

A :  It's not too
D :  We've got a two way
A :  We did the project evaluation based on um
D :  But i think works
A :  It's a it's evaluation of on off switch as an
D :  Kind of thought was really technically an evaluation of the product not the project
D :  In general
