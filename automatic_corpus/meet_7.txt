A :  Okay
A :  Okay
C :  Uh-huh
A :  So we are here for
A :  The concept design meeting
A :  So
A :  Well we're the first doubt by a summarising the um
A :  The previous meeting and a decision and we've taken
A :  Uh i will take notes during these meetings so that you can uh look at my uh for there to c. d.
A :  Summary of this meeting afterwards
A :  So each of you will uh uh
A :  Show us to our use investigation that done during
A :  Uh the previews uh uh
A :  Ours
A :  We'd and to take a decision concept and then
A :  Uh i we we lady find the next next task
A :  To have to be done before the next meeting
A :  So last time we decided to
A :  I have a simpler interface
A :  We uh so these idea to have uh a way to to change china pretty sure that then
A :  China d. geez
A :  Uh buttons should be uh protected by a plastic or uh something called uh
A :  Remote control to look very simple or
A :  We have our so button for volume and to switch
A :  And off the t. v.
A :  We are more so uh the the lighting in the future
A :  For the remote control to be easy to find
A :  And four five development and we will crest we have decided to
A :  I have no wait c. d. in all voice features
A :  So now uh we have three presentations
A :  So the concept u. s. b. c. station by industrial designer
A :  The the sophistication of
A :  D. light by
A :  Or
C :  Doesn't it
C :  My name's
A :  Okay
A :  And the the the last point to use the trendwatching by a market expert
A :  So maybe we can start we is uh the industrial design
A :  So
A :  This is
A :  The presentation
B :  Uh-huh i. d. u.
A :  Maybe i can switch slide um your request
B :  They only have three slides so i just look at the um
B :  Um
B :  Just use
B :  When someone pages
A :  Yeah
B :  To find some documentation and i think the remote control is a phrase mention
B :  Previously
B :  You just have a a very simple chip
B :  And um
B :  The user interface is just than usually by pushbutton and in our case we are using the
B :  Um so we control so
B :  Uh
B :  Uh i was looking basically for that shape
B :  Which is a very very stand up and uh i just go for that we use and so on the list on a pushbutton
B :  And um
B :  Yeah we can challenge do it in fact i have the number of that it's an amount which is very strong all four
B :  Remote control of the pushbutton are usually extremely cheap
B :  But i just have one problem and this is related with that we've sensible which seems to be quite expensive
A :  Okay
B :  And i think we if we could just talk about that if we we needed we sense all all you can uh if we if we can combine something with the pushbuttons
A :  Okay
B :  Uh uh we sense or is fifty percent of the price of uh
B :  Uh a pushbutton
A :  But is it is significant price on the
A :  War remote control
A :  "'cause" we can uh fold up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control
B :  Yeah alright
A :  So we we we these we is uh including or with you but things scroll buttons we
A :  And it cheap
A :  Be a lower than twelve euros to produce
B :  But i don't think that's uh
B :  We should
B :  Should talk about some of the design of the box and so which need some money
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay
C :  I also have to say do you uh to see the email about the voice settlement sure
B :  Or mm that's a tough
C :  No
A :  You receive something
B :  I haven't yeah
C :  Yeah we'll call uh any maybe from a one because we need is in the house
C :  Basically it was only some cheap already there but
A :  Hmm
C :  Yeah
C :  This is a a they'd notice use it to uh to uh to colour their eyes us to particular questions
C :  But i guess it could be
A :  And the d. v. uh that t. do
C :  I'll give it was a bunch of according uh so you can just
C :  Uh record uh
C :  Something simpler like
A :  Okay and they're can there we can i some common yeah
C :  Yeah you know that one ask "'em" are you gonna call and you come on
C :  So if you already have the the eye that's it
A :  Yeah
C :  You can use it
A :  Okay maybe we can just the the centre this presentation and then the decision later
C :  Okay
A :  According to do is news
B :  Yeah
B :  But i think it's a yeah sorry i haven't read to my personal reference
B :  Um
B :  And uh i just want to mention the the problem of uh
B :  Uh
B :  We use and so which is
B :  Much more expensive but then you push button and if we could meet use and that's
A :  Okay
B :  We're we have already some
B :  Good things um with uh
B :  Um
B :  With the backlight of the pushbutton
C :  Have a question a lot of
C :  Uh um
C :  What is the purpose of the like
B :  Just to it to make something which is a slightly more design and that's uh
B :  Uh it's very box with a rubber
A :  You can use you find the button the dark or so
C :  But in in the dark uh
C :  Yeah but you going to go spend on the like
A :  It would be done on when the
A :  When the user move it a remote control raising no
C :  But if you movie then you have you
A :  Hmm
C :  You can see the buttons but of course
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah true
C :  But as you move it to you have to have some sense of
C :  When you move it to the to the movie
B :  As soon as you start to move of the the remote control you have the lights
C :  Yeah but you need another sense of about uh
B :  Yeah
B :  Again
C :  You know it's expensive
B :  I don't think that this is really expensive but uh the and this is plenty of
B :  And expand the
B :  Very cheap
C :  Yeah okay
B :  Device ease but it's uh the biggest cost me
C :  Yeah but like so those are we to be too but you can read that are expensive so
B :  First of all i was thinking to have a look on to use like don't you
B :  But went you you you you you press the on button you have the lights
B :  But your remote controller went you you want to turn off
B :  You device
A :  But it can be uh battery "'cause" you mean no
A :  To have the like always on
B :  Uh and it sort of it
B :  It's a great
A :  Where we just is that after maybe uh
C :  Okay
A :  Do the presentation
C :  Well my a one need uh should be there shared folder
A :  Yeah
C :  Last time so
A :  And you to use
C :  So
A :  Okay
C :  Yes most uh huh
C :  It's like
C :  And with you
C :  Yeah
C :  Wants but simple correct
C :  It's a major idea
A :  Yeah
C :  I suppose pose
C :  So i just looked at some kind designs uh on the web off
C :  You do more complicated not controls
C :  And as you get two of "'em"
C :  "'cause" uh huh even though they have many buttons look quite simple and
C :  No i guess we just
C :  It could take the buttons are we
A :  Yeah
C :  And even government but
A :  And also does it uh a few twenty nine
A :  Because it was uh
A :  Do your wrist problem with the users
C :  What is this it is a these in was a quite big so would the next page
C :  So
C :  We have all the buttons so you can see a lot more still then we just need a once in a meeting
A :  Yeah
C :  So
C :  From the bottom or whatever there
A :  Yeah
C :  Uh the of the numbers and then the top
C :  Uh i do that and it's
C :  This movie part
C :  And the last one is exactly the same for this team or this
C :  How would that would be the volume control big fan control
C :  And meeting power yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Is the basic think
A :  So it's only the central part
C :  So basically of stuff where would we would look more or less the same of these two
A :  Yeah it was uh
A :  Maybe a
A :  More economy design on the
C :  Yeah if we have for example
C :  I think that the volume and the buttons are available but not very easy to reach we thought it would be
A :  Yeah
C :  On the right side for example
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah
C :  "'cause" we don't have these input buttons and those are the stuff that they have
C :  And i think that the plastic colours not very good
C :  Uh idea because
A :  Okay
C :  You open it it come break you can uh a lot of things
A :  Okay
C :  You just need to put their channel numbers
C :  Somewhere bit out of the way
A :  Okay
C :  So if that's a pretty can be yeah
A :  Ah okay
C :  Uh to to put it out there the big buttons but there
C :  It's not be difficult to present that a buttons either
C :  I think that you put the colour to be even more difficult for user
A :  Okay
C :  Uh one yeah
C :  You do what the home of the circuit board put the plastic cover on things that
C :  You know one of the mess with black buttons for the tuning the tennis and stuff like that
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah i do and put it in
C :  And i think it's uh it's it is no
A :  Okay
C :  So i don't think
C :  Yeah is it is there the wheely
C :  You there are some was a bit down could use it down of the wheel for the court if we want
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
C :  So we just busy to use one just a wheel and uh user where you just that we didn't think
A :  Yeah
C :  That sounds
C :  That case
A :  Maybe there we will be uh
A :  Would advantage euro competitors
A :  Because otherwise it's pretty stand out about the fact that that's very simple or
A :  So maybe
A :  Discourse
A :  To uh
A :  To have more
A :  Expense and that's that suspect
C :  Yeah just uh
C :  Mike addicted to have a lot but
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
A :  So we can move to the
A :  Is there any questions
A :  Four
A :  Design off user interface
A :  Or we can move to the next parts
A :  Maybe and discuss
A :  Afterwards
A :  Okay
D :  You can do
D :  So now the recent investigation
D :  We
D :  I've done
D :  Full of the remote control it's um
D :  So so most important aspect for remote controls
D :  Is to be fancy look and feel and not to go round functional look indian
D :  And um the second aspect
D :  Is uh is that the remote control should be
D :  At technological innovative
A :  Okay
D :  And the said most important aspect is to
D :  To me is that the cup remote control should be easy to use
D :  So
D :  That seems we we have
D :  Well
D :  Speak about before
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah and um
D :  So that you you can do
D :  After
D :  And that as a fashion watchers in paris and you know that have detected the following trends
D :  Uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes is shoes and furniture else
D :  So um
D :  Maybe for our remote control has to be
D :  And food for more predictable forms
D :  Something like that so
A :  Okay
B :  Wasn't it
D :  Uh huh
D :  And um them at a yellow is expected to be spongy
D :  Well i don't know
D :  Which made a l.
D :  Can be spongy and if you
A :  This is good though so far
C :  But will
C :  I think all kinds of them you just
C :  Today functional spongy think it would work right
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  I think it is but those those
A :  To have a spongy bread yeah yeah
C :  You can throw it said that they live here
A :  Yeah because it's it's robust
B :  Yeah it's a
D :  It's or was it
C :  To a uh the could one would say that we should fruity colours uh so then it's loading the television it turns it off
A :  Yeah
C :  Wait the texas look
A :  Yeah um sorry yeah
D :  And it had
B :  I know that they do that for um clock or so
D :  And and and didn't use that you can yeah you can see that
C :  Yeah
D :  You get
D :  Yeah we can do and
D :  Before
A :  Before
D :  Before yes
D :  And you know yeah the the most important aspect is the fancy look and feel
A :  Yeah
D :  I've days the technology can innovative and after the easy to use
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah i think it's innovative to use the um
A :  There we because i think no one and s. i. s.
D :  Yeah that's right yeah that's a i think we have to keep that it's if it's possible
A :  And it's
A :  Yeah i think it's
A :  It makes it was easy and goes in as a innovative so
D :  Innovative
A :  I think it's a bit aspects and it should get
C :  How would you can
C :  Is a question
A :  Colour fancy
C :  Yeah
A :  We have to make it look
A :  Like a fruit or veg is a
D :  Yeah
A :  Maybe a
B :  And uh
A :  Uh um
A :  The colour that's remember some fruit uh
D :  Oh it glowing
A :  Inside that's
C :  A little boosting it about nine i guess
A :  I
A :  Maybe
D :  But it would be for example uh you know as p. is like that it's and it's easy to
D :  To have in in harm's and uh
A :  And it's ergonomic as well
A :  But here
C :  The bottom a lot of um
A :  Yeah maybe it here yeah something that
D :  Oh a fruit like that i know
A :  Yeah
A :  We can discuss that at the e. d. is there anything you want to add
C :  Either in different colours use spongy
D :  Yeah
A :  I don't think so
A :  I think we we can have a like yeah a year is good
A :  It when it all bad and i used to live
D :  If if if if
C :  Yeah
A :  I think that
B :  Fall maybe
B :  Look and feel of what's was a piece of a nice
B :  We from the u. n. e. d. inside
A :  But that's not in the train the trendy spongy and digit they were fruits
B :  Yeah
D :  I think
C :  That's that's out there that and
A :  I think the spongy is a good because it's it's will be robust as well
B :  Yeah
A :  So i think we can keep the wheel
A :  Because it's so easy it's innovative and you the cost is of it i or
A :  And
A :  We're still have to find the so the fruit like p. on banana with uh in your notes i do you uh
A :  What kind of fruit would like to
A :  To control your t. v. with
D :  Thank you
B :  And then i think it's a nice idea
A :  Banana his own soul yellow so you you got close
A :  Your remote controller then
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  You you you don't use of the bad and uh
B :  And do that and eyes tearing like that but when the banana is curving right that's
C :  So the button yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  With the wheel on the top
C :  Yeah
B :  And to control and here you have the the pushbutton
D :  But you don't have
B :  Two
A :  I think it's a good idea
C :  Yes we gotta sell the
C :  Just how the scare me and
C :  You move it you're fancier to press the button on to that you move the on the other side
A :  Yeah
C :  To to have them on two sides and week we
A :  Yeah
A :  I think it's uh uh a good design and it's innovative as a way of them
A :  Maybe we can keep the banana and it would be very easy to find
B :  And uh everybody knows what he's a banana basically
C :  Yeah but that's about it doesn't it
B :  If you if you stop with a fancy fruits
C :  Ah you have topic
B :  Oh yeah
C :  And talk on the file at the bottom and that fits with the colour scheme a lot of combining
C :  Since it's
B :  Or or yeah i
A :  Yeah it's really you really a good point
C :  Since it's
D :  If if if
C :  I hope you see that's a nice and i think it's
C :  "'em"
C :  There were closing the meeting
A :  I think it
A :  So
A :  Let's and
A :  So we have to take from d. c. and then there's the spec so
A :  Uhuh
A :  So for
A :  Sorry for
A :  Uh components
A :  So
B :  So
A :  We have to think about those suspects sorry
B :  So we we just use the stand-up battery
A :  Yeah
B :  And uh the chip we eh
B :  Chip-on-print we know exactly which one they're going to use
B :  Uh what do you mean by case
A :  I think it's the box that should be spongy
A :  But then as shape
B :  Uh i mean it for me if we use the spongy banana case
B :  It doesn't matter i just want to have some something to train to to fix my
C :  So that's
C :  Yeah
B :  My components
B :  On to that box and that's it
C :  You can't be in the inside danish talk to
B :  Yeah yeah yeah
C :  But the the thing is that
C :  The bottom so no we have to be i mean if it's spongy then there but also no we have to
B :  Spongy
C :  Um if we didn't want to move right
C :  So
C :  Can be banned them
C :  So that was the buttons
B :  Oh i know i think it's possible
C :  Things but
A :  No the button would be
A :  In fact it it should be something out shaped with the spongy cover
B :  Yeah
C :  Okay
B :  Macy's um i uh
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay are shape we spongy
A :  Cover
A :  And the start battery okay the chip-on-print there's no specific program so we agree to put do we do
B :  Uh-huh
B :  We on the top
B :  But then whether we want some buttons
C :  Word
C :  User you could
C :  You wanted to be good that's for the list and you that's right
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh
A :  So we'd have to do it has to be seen it cheaper
C :  Yeah but it's okay it's a that's a that's
C :  Though
C :  It doesn't do that you can pick two sides
C :  One on this this i would've the sample and the other side where there's uh
C :  Yeah under the sun
B :  Yeah
C :  Or you could use
C :  You this one but once the most critical for them to use this one for the wheel
A :  Yeah maybe this time you small one for that but
C :  Before the wheel and then this for the buttons
A :  Yeah i think it's okay for most so right and left
B :  Uh-huh
C :  From the left
C :  You have
C :  Nope
A :  I think you can turn it this way round so
A :  You can do was this
C :  We buttons
C :  Yeah but i mean if we have buttons and will they wanted and down the buttons on the other side
C :  You can see them
A :  When you uh you will get used to it
A :  I'm all the
C :  Out of the beach yeah and the wheel
A :  But and are a light c. d. so or you
A :  You're immediately then decide the right side
A :  Because you have like ten buttons
C :  Yeah i know but uh if you believe yeah that and then the witch yeah
C :  And the buttons like yeah
C :  They wanted and down
C :  The buttons would go about this at it
A :  No you
A :  You i think you will use it onion the right or left and
A :  With uh you write see a nifty
A :  I think for lefties okay
A :  I can do this moment and for right is where
A :  I think these doesn't change that much
C :  Okay
A :  Yeah
C :  Okay
A :  So
A :  For interface we say though so that we have uh
A :  This band then uh shape
A :  With a button and that's on the side
A :  And
A :  And the the wheel on the top
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So the colour is yellow or
A :  I think it's uh we define everything cutting through
A :  What we should
A :  But the decision we should take yeah
A :  So maybe we can uh um
A :  We can the the mm
A :  Walk
A :  And do that speced
A :  Uh and the next meeting
A :  So i have the the finer the look-and-feel design according to this easy and
A :  And have the the user interface design
A :  And uh then evaluate the produce the product
A :  That is to say ah
A :  Jackie if
A :  Each sheet
A :  The
A :  The requirements uh given by the users
A :  But uh according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay
A :  It seems to be you fancy innovative and easy to use
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So
A :  So
A :  To develop prototype
A :  I would say that that's d. industrial designer and the user interface designer
A :  Uh work together that would uh
A :  You better i think
A :  And uh
A :  And so uh uh
A :  You will receive uh instruction by email is that she's right
C :  Uh-huh yes must that
A :  During need to have a meeting
C :  No
A :  You feel okay
C :  Yeah
A :  You feel a a free to express which you went to say
C :  Yeah
A :  You know if you too
A :  Constraints
A :  Does it free to answer this
C :  You can with the war uh uh
A :  I
A :  Okay so
B :  Thank you
A :  So you're
B :  Just
