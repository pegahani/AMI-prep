C :  Cool
A :  Oh
C :  Oh
A :  Hmm
A :  Okay
C :  "'cause" everyone's
A :  Hi
B :  Hey
A :  So well at your far the detailed design meeting
A :  So
A :  We will uh yeah we'll first present but we are going to do in this meeting
A :  Then
A :  Uh i i will also take notes doing this meeting and i was saying you uh uh
A :  The summary then as usual
A :  We will begin look at
A :  The evaluation could tear out of the prototype presentation by here
A :  Or or two colleagues
A :  That's me
A :  Could work
D :  For for for for that
A :  And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product
A :  And then we'll or uh
A :  Evaluate the product
A :  And uh and uh
A :  With the conclusion of this project and see whether it feeds
A :  We isn't it for if you use it for a few the requirement on that
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So
A :  Let's start with the cost aspects so
A :  So i look at the uh spec discussed last time that is to say uh to have uh some uh battery
A :  To have a uh you'll banana shaped uh case we is uh
A :  Uh rubber my tail "'round" it to be uh to feel spongy
C :  Like about us
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And uh uh also uh the different aspects like having a wee you know
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Except for
A :  And the cost and you to be ten point seven year olds so which is a good because
A :  We have the price gap off
A :  Twelve point five euros
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So all four and the financial aspect it's okay
A :  We can uh
A :  We can continue was these products uh as if
A :  And we all know going to see the project evaluation with
A :  Uh uh or marketing expert
D :  So um you can have many
A :  Yeah
D :  Project team
A :  You have a presentation on
D :  Uh yeah just to
A :  And for yes
D :  Evaluation
A :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Okay thank you go
D :  You can go through

A :  Okay
D :  Okay so
D :  Uh we have
D :  Uh six parts
D :  We
D :  We talked about before
D :  So we we want rather put it fancy look and feel
D :  Technology coding let's see if easy to use station
D :  Easy to find the room and robust
A :  Yeah
D :  Uh and uh uh i have a scale of um
D :  Seven points
A :  Yeah
D :  Okay so i'll i'll go through all of the of the points yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  And
D :  Uh
D :  According to what you think about the this
D :  Project you can uh make
D :  A one point two point of seven points okay
A :  Okay
D :  And after we we have than an average and uh we see
A :  Okay
D :  There okay
D :  Uh so
D :  Oh a fancy look and see what do you think
A :  Maybe you can prison
D :  Between what one and say then

A :  Like
A :  New word so
A :  I think i would use or five
C :  No they were four
B :  Four so
B :  "'cause" it except that we we don't have so much innovation
B :  The rubber is
A :  Okay
C :  Double including the voice uh i will be in a look within the voice and you want
B :  Of all i i
A :  No
C :  No
C :  Okay
A :  So
A :  What's you or a great

D :  We can put far
D :  Everyone is okay all
A :  For yeah let's put four
D :  Four
D :  Okay
A :  Doesn't
D :  Be easy to use to think is it's easy to use
A :  Yeah i think so
C :  I give a seven i think
A :  Yeah
B :  Six
A :  I would use a uh huh
A :  Or give a seven is when it's very easy to use
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Mm sixth for me a four
B :  Six
D :  I'm fine
A :  Six point five
B :  So you say six months
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Is it station
A :  Oh yeah it's it's it's fruits
D :  Seven i
A :  Which shape i would say seven
A :  And it's very very nice these
D :  It's a shame because it's a fruits and we say that same
C :  Uh we call the seventh yeah yeah
B :  Yeah seven
D :  Yes and
A :  Seven okay
C :  Would hope
B :  Easy to find
D :  Uh easy to find you know room
A :  I
B :  I i like that and i
A :  I think we've got me see it
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay
B :  Uh oh
C :  Yeah i think it's good

D :  Where's the late mean to
D :  Are
A :  Yeah we have to do it
A :  We don't see is is is it yeah the like
C :  Yeah but ah spot and so it it's a lights up completely for
A :  So it's you know it's okay i think it's very easy to
D :  Yeah it it's
D :  Say that
A :  I would say so and it's up to me see it
B :  Six
B :  Yeah okay
C :  Yeah
D :  It is it robust
A :  Yeah it's rubber
B :  Oh
B :  Four and
A :  Made of rubber i think it's an it's uh more of those and uh or their remote control
C :  Yeah it only problem there might be that we we don't know if it's too sensitive
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah we
B :  Yeah
C :  I don't know
A :  But you'd is a it is surrounded by rubber um i dunno
C :  Yeah okay
B :  Yeah
A :  So maybe we can put the six
B :  Yeah
B :  Six o. five
D :  Nobody it's a case six
B :  Five
A :  Sixes okay
C :  Yeah one
B :  Six
D :  Okay
D :  Now i
A :  Is it uh
D :  Um so
A :  Have to sum up
C :  Twenty
D :  So attain a fancy twenty six can try
D :  And uh set it to us it's a six and so
C :  But it
D :  That's that's okay
D :  Six
C :  Okay
A :  Six easy but
D :  If we use a that's a then it's uh
A :  Yeah they they
D :  It's the data and when the
A :  Okay so sixties the
D :  Put it it's a good at predicting think
C :  So when you come with some
A :  So it's a bit evaluation i think
A :  It's very pro my zing
C :  Yeah with the biased
D :  We have a good price and uh
C :  Okay
A :  So this prototype is is quite nice
C :  "'cause" i saw uh uh some for not worry about shape
A :  Yeah
C :  Uh uh a wireless phones not more but what what are the files
A :  Okay
C :  Uh uh quite big actual and the worst so i think yeah i know some for uh uh
C :  Some to make it and it used to find it euros
C :  That's the that's the phone what is it
A :  So i think this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive i think
C :  Yeah
A :  I think the
B :  Also the complexity between the phone and the remote control is not
B :  Cannot come to a
C :  Yeah it might work on that but
A :  Yeah
A :  So
A :  I think
A :  We can summarise
A :  So we have seen the prototype it's
A :  Very nice
A :  According to the work of four to design it
A :  The the
A :  The the financial aspect where okay
A :  We we have the costs you uh or threshold and
A :  So we could say that twenty five euros energy
A :  Make profits
A :  The the the evaluation give
A :  So exciting results as well
A :  So i think we can move to the last part of the meeting
A :  So
A :  The coast these
A :  In the project
A :  Be very chinese okay
A :  So i think i think we can open champagne and
A :  Make your your spots use
A :  I dunno if it's true
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  Later meeting stuff
A :  I
C :  Okay
A :  Okay so can which is a shame
C :  Can i just have a team there are you and it would be good for custody
A :  Nice but it's
A :  Yeah
A :  I think it was a good collaboration
C :  Uh
C :  Sort of them um that's it
A :  Sorry
C :  What does the models it is
A :  I agree eleventh but be a project in this time around a much bigger salary as well
C :  Yeah
A :  Well it depends on the watch this meeting
A :  I think
A :  We don't know
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay
C :  Okay
A :  So
