C :  It's put that back
A :  Uh nope got this thing uh-huh i
D :  But maybe it's just
A :  No it was that they're not here now it's here and not they are
A :  And one more time
A :  It should come up the right way around
D :  There you go
A :  Hiking
A :  I
B :  Just just carry on
A :  Okay carry on i
A :  Ah right
A :  Um this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting
A :  Um
A :  A rich and uh
A :  Should be on the were hoping the meeting i have the minutes from the previous meeting or on the shared for try that this point
A :  Um and we should each have a presentation to make
A :  Um we have certain decisions to make "'em" we have forty minutes total
A :  It's twenty five after two
A :  At the moment so forty minutes is
A :  Five year after three
A :  Um which are be keeping an eye on the
A :  Clock forests
A :  Mm "'kay"
A :  Um but there are the decisions we have to turn to
A :  But we'll come back to them in a minute after i. e.
A :  Take us to be
A :  Minutes
A :  Of
A :  Previous meeting
A :  Right um
A :  As we remember i opened the meeting but for us for president
A :  The meeting the first meetings minutes reviewed and approved
A :  Um uh sarah you percent of marketing research report
A :  Um which
A :  Pretty much work for percent of the fifteen to thirty five year olds
A :  Um i have to be hand-held
A :  Power channel volume number keys possibly speech recognition
A :  And then staff did the second presentation
A :  Um mm that those
A :  Functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys
A :  There were easy to use
A :  I think almost agreed with those things
A :  "'kay" percent of the working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard
A :  Um that it should be a simple mass-produced device because of the twelve and a half pounds cost
A :  Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries
A :  And having a docking places a selling point
A :  Um and the new requirements that are for be for t. v. only
A :  Um and medically with that but so slogan and colour of the um corporate
A :  Design be included
A :  Um
A :  The corporate image
A :  So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than cents
A :  They were decision makers alternatively would be a manufacturer to close with t. v. pen is josh me those parameters
A :  Um and the function
A :  We agreed was volume power numbers
A :  And sure
A :  Channels
A :  A way to move between channels
A :  Easy to use and hand-held
A :  Um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition
A :  What what are the current ones sell for
A :  Um and stuff was gonna look at that ergonomics
A :  Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed
A :  And i was to type of these planets and work on the final report
A :  Is this uh
A :  Fair
A :  Presentation of what our last meeting was
C :  Yes
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
A :  Right
A :  So we're ready to
A :  Was that
A :  Go back to our
A :  That one
A :  Right
A :  We're up to the point of d.
A :  Go back
A :  Um
A :  The three presentations
A :  So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn this error
A :  Is that okay
A :  Sorry but everybody else
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Especially since case to be last
A :  I
A :  So i'm sorry if i missed out your name i dunno what is the s. a. or a or a safer it a touch
D :  Uh respond to be a norris
A :  This part or whatever you get out
A :  Okay
A :  Um did you do your
C :  Yeah it's too
A :  Ah there it is
A :  Time
D :  Okay first thing i want to address as um
D :  One of the points that for this product which was a car cost of the competition devices similar to the ones that stuff me
D :  Uh i showed us and
D :  And if there
D :  Add twenty to sixty years depending on um branding
D :  Some of them i have a higher than recognition or in the more expensive and
D :  But i think
D :  That with the current um price were searching for well within
D :  Even on them hour and
D :  Of the um
D :  Of the market
A :  Okay
D :  No i'm going to move on to
D :  More interesting um
D :  More vibrant things
D :  So
D :  I'm guessing that uh remote control market there in greater detail and marianne theme for most work on was uh
D :  Trendwatch
D :  And
B :  So it's
A :  I
B :  I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so i will spend yes
D :  I know that you all are distance from cutting edge marketing research so in on the screen track look at it really
D :  Professional terms here
D :  What's hot fruit and veg
D :  Spongy
D :  And this is all over the cat walks paris milan and i'm talking about
D :  Clothing
D :  Furniture
D :  She was
D :  This is really interesting change from past years because it is much more organic
D :  Um so would say approach all
D :  And i think if we're to me fashion our view
D :  Of
D :  What we want to in a remote control
D :  Should perhaps think about incorporating
D :  Technologically interesting fabrics
D :  And some of the bold colours into a simple
D :  Handset so
D :  I also we did a little research on um
D :  What again are the most important
D :  Priorities in a decision making about it um
D :  Purchasing
D :  Fancy
D :  Functional is out
D :  And for the fancy and that's exactly the german i'm thinking polish to
D :  Elegant
D :  You know kind of innovative but a cut above
D :  This is twice as important as the next finding which is technologically innovative this is interesting "'cause" i think the last meeting we were talking about technology has been so important but
D :  Maybe it's innovative is having a simple
D :  With um
D :  We have uh
D :  Technologically
D :  Superior
D :  Fabrics or
D :  Uh
D :  You know design an interesting substances
D :  Ease of use again pretty well oh i mean it's the top three but each of the
D :  Uh fancy in technologically innovative are far more important
D :  So
D :  I think we should cloak
D :  This streamlined remote control device in a series of
D :  Oh
D :  For it
D :  Fruit mean that's we use
B :  That's a good idea
B :  Thank you i
D :  Yeah
C :  Yes
A :  If it's like the the the covers that they used for the remote just
D :  You know
D :  Exactly
A :  Yeah you tell yourself um
D :  Exactly
D :  I was thinking know that instead of having something
D :  Oh like patterned you know so
D :  You know something similar to a summer grass that you have like fruit and veg is that we actually make these spongy
A :  Mm
D :  They could be in the initially i thought we could start with kind of um
D :  Fruit that
D :  Would suits kind of a a longer
D :  A hand held so banana a pineapple and pair
D :  Um because actually this we can
D :  Take up a lot of time allotment and
D :  The remote control we just a minute reduction us on it they could be interchangeable
D :  They're spongy that goes back to ergonomic
D :  And the youngsters lot of fun for the whole family everyone can have a round
D :  So what we're talking about
D :  Is jean jean-yves
D :  This concept everyone has a t. v. remote
D :  But then we had in the fact that they can each have their own individual fruit
D :  That's what's on on the cat walks
D :  So this is mine
D :  So swollen think um
A :  Mm
C :  Um
A :  Um
A :  In most families don't
A :  Isn't the remote use a remote
D :  Yeah but i think i think with this would allow is perhaps a personal family witness opinion about it we all need a remote but the person who was really
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Perhaps
D :  Active in personalising i'm thinking a teenager the someone fifteen to thirty five
D :  We go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that
D :  People would get us off um covers
C :  So and it that's it in their overriding your decision going now we're gonna watch this you can bring a year anniversary like
C :  Is that what we're gonna watch bus
D :  Okay
D :  Yeah or an a plus i think
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Well actually some households do have three and four
D :  Yeah
A :  T. v.s and they would have a remote for each one so
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah so this is an i. d. and i i am
D :  You know this is exactly what the research
D :  Has uh a sham
D :  So really open this up to uh
D :  Any other feedback this
D :  Spongy
D :  Fruit and veg
B :  Yeah
D :  Thanks
B :  I think we can have some trouble when we get down to be component design on this spongy is gonna be difficult i'm afraid
D :  Ah right
C :  Yeah
A :  Hmm
A :  Hmm
C :  And as for
C :  As for uh
C :  Um
C :  Well but just thing as well if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable
C :  Components
D :  It would just have my ear to the market has
C :  The system like well
B :  Yeah i mean basically we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber
B :  A special rubber is the closest a spongy yeah
D :  A spongy means yeah
D :  That would add
B :  I was thinking titanium myself
C :  I was thinking titanium i was thinking it's just
C :  I have been influenced by pictures of ipods
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And i also
C :  Minimalist and sherry me
D :  They are and they they with a film the uh first
D :  Um
D :  Priority which is fancy i think many of us to assess it does with nancy
D :  Something else we could do is um
D :  Call it something that's fruit and veg
D :  Or it could be could call it uh
A :  Are we talking about
A :  The device itself or that work for for the device to be and interchangeable called cover as a separate
D :  The name
A :  Product
D :  Well it would be a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable
A :  Perhaps perhaps that's on that particular suggestion need to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product
D :  So
C :  Yeah that's kind of point less of a
C :  Yeah
D :  That you know that might be
C :  Let's delegate
A :  What would that be a agreeable
D :  And then we could keep but titanium
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh what what would it be helpful if um by describe the components a bit because i think it would give you um
B :  Maybe bring this discussion back to us of what we can actually physically do
C :  Yeah maybe
A :  Do you wanna be next or you want to go next
C :  I think possibly maybe more useful f. k. or the next
A :  Okay
A :  Mm yeah
C :  Um
B :  I
B :  Yeah
C :  You can even have them in different flavours as well it so if you just wanna sit there and shoo on the remote they could be like
D :  Yeah force or smelly
C :  Pair flavour
C :  Yeah scratches no i
D :  Scratch you
D :  Well i was really thing a lot about the
D :  Um i
D :  Um the imac
D :  Kind of show
D :  Jan hmm
D :  It's hard on the streets yes
B :  Right well uh i i think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some more things i have to tell you what i'm afraid this is the real one
B :  So yeah
B :  Um
B :  I've been looking at be
B :  The basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate
B :  Um i've had some discussions with them at manufacturing division you have told me
B :  What's actually available
B :  Yeah what kind state of the offing components is and so exciting new things like got that
B :  Oh sure that
B :  It's quite what you want um
B :  And this isn't a very good at the head but this is just to show you this is the innards of
B :  A remote control um
B :  I mean you need
B :  And or something uh and that's what i'm
B :  Um oh yeah casing my little mouse pointer
B :  This is this is the uh huh
B :  A remote that's been opened up
B :  Um that's the the back of the interface
B :  And this is a pushbutton one c. c.s all
B :  A button see a little rubber
B :  Rubber buttons that goes through onto the
B :  Appalled that
B :  Um i
B :  Push these buttons here
B :  Um
B :  And we that's the basic
B :  Construction the we've got two
B :  Got to accommodate we don't have something that push is a little buttons that
B :  Um talk to the chip
B :  Uh encourage them s. each
B :  That sends the message to the receiver
B :  So
B :  Um
B :  A one i wanna go through it not not just addressing the um
B :  And be the points you made several that um
B :  Do my presentation in the aldrich it
B :  I have
B :  So first role um i would
B :  Talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source um we can have yet but standard double double a. batteries and uh
B :  Replaceable
B :  Um well compartment
B :  We can have
C :  A wind-up
B :  A wind-up i
B :  Which i think it's quite interesting concept for that
B :  For remote control but it may be used
B :  Does it quite go with the um the fruit and veg
B :  I
A :  Ah ah ah ah
B :  Um
A :  Ah right
B :  Well well well no i think it's quite interesting is the kinetic energy source where um
A :  And we only have forty minutes
B :  You you actually get the energy by moving the device which is kind of nice to meet when you have take it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work but you have to sort of threat thing and something a little work
B :  All we we have to that solar power but i think we agreed that that's not so good in the dark
A :  Mm
B :  Now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case it can be made of
B :  Plastic rubber wood
B :  If you like oh
B :  Or titanium
B :  Um
B :  And then there's we've got just to use spongy there i guess it's rubber but um
B :  Well i'm gonna come back to it on to the titanium
B :  And basically it can have a flat surface a curved surface or double curved surface but i think if we wanna use standard components we're gonna have difficulty with anything much be on that
B :  Okay what is the interface look like
B :  Um well pushbutton that's that's the one where all familiar with
B :  Um what we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll-button can incorporate the porch so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down change volume and channel something like that and push two
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Select something
B :  Um you can have multiple scroll buttons um this is
B :  Maybe getting a little bit complicated but it's um it's in the technology is there
B :  And we can also incorporate an l. c. d. display in the remote
B :  But this will increase the cost
B :  Oh mm
B :  Um the electronics it's actually makes the device work
B :  We've basically all three
B :  Simple regular or advanced on the price goes up
B :  Uh speech is if this if we want a nice cheap one of the simple then we can then we have pushbuttons we have a fancy interface designs got when i'm afraid
B :  Um
B :  A little bit more for regular chip and you can have scroll buttons
B :  If you want the advanced chip you don't use it costs more but it that's what you need if you want the l. c. d. display
B :  And the manufacture and if we shouldn't tell me that they have recently developed
B :  Um sample sensor sample speaker devices know i i well i guess but
B :  I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere
B :  Um our real expertise is in pushbuttons i have to say that
B :  Maybe you think that's old technology
B :  And
B :  Well i i think we've got two options we can either go for really cheap model people would we
B :  Costs down um which it means a flat plastic case and what we battery and simple push buttons
B :  Or we can have something that looks a bit my so i think
B :  Um it might necessary do it look like a pineapple but um
B :  That may or may i
D :  If
B :  Sorry
B :  Um
B :  But it could have an l. c. d. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could have three be
B :  Companies new development of three um sample sensor speaker
B :  So thank you
D :  That sounds good any idea what you you mention
D :  That they would be a cost difference
D :  Um do you have any idea if if
D :  This
D :  If the fancy model
D :  Could be done in
D :  Twelve
D :  Euros fifty
B :  Yeah i'm from i don't have that information available um
B :  Manufacturing didn't actually give attach any price is too many things on print
A :  Oh
D :  Uh-huh because
D :  And i i'm being quite serious may say that that um the things i mentioned are
D :  But i think the them pointing might be to choose one
D :  You know if if we get on me is is um some these things are just are feasible
B :  Yeah
D :  Maybe we could to send that any mean we call it a a blackberry
D :  That's uh
C :  They're they're in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company so
C :  What i've been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with the logo on it
B :  No no
D :  Yeah well what's in the
C :  But
C :  Um
C :  I i don't know how you important matters
C :  To keep exactly the colours of the real reaction company is just what i understood
D :  Yeah
C :  We do go that's for it harder for all this
C :  Part that's for the future through price
D :  But yeah i'm trying to streamline mind a little bit
B :  We we could we could do a um a double curved rapple one which would allow
B :  Say a banana
B :  But um unfortunately from one it's that if we do that we have to have a pushbutton
B :  As the interface we can't do anything fancy a
D :  Yeah
D :  Hmm
C :  So we wait so i
B :  I
D :  Yeah
C :  So i showed you for well my extensive presentation
C :  I
C :  On what sort of interfaces
C :  Are available
D :  Thank you yep
A :  Thank you think
C :  You could see think we just
C :  In more detail well i've got a
C :  So went a bit pointless
B :  I
C :  F. and and f. eight thirty so
A :  Yes
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  I
C :  I don't have um i know
D :  Um i think um
D :  Four inches of that by
B :  If you do
D :  F. eight again
A :  Do it again
B :  F. and f. eight again it's
A :  Keep doing it and so you get a ball
A :  You did they are you getting you wars but now that one and then you get it all
B :  You you can
C :  To do it again
D :  Maybe
A :  Yeah
A :  This time if you come up or
C :  Um ryan
C :  I don't
C :  Actually have a huge amount of different information that case that's just
A :  Okay
C :  But my method was to look at be
C :  Well my my inspiration switch well is
C :  A big collection of lots of different it's
C :  Models of
C :  Remote controls and other things they use a similar sort of thing including m. p. three players
C :  Uh
C :  Take your hi-fi remotes not just television these things
C :  Uh i have a think about the feature the features of each one is
C :  Um
C :  What functions we actually need and then hated group and a range these on the actual
C :  The actual
C :  Plastic or rubber
C :  Hand held piece
C :  Uh i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel
C :  Which
C :  I i couldn't find the picture the ipod what are the links to web production i couldn't copy and paste that
C :  But a had a similar thing to this thing on the right it has
C :  Uh scroll wheels
C :  What i
C :  Without a display but they they scroll like a computer nice
C :  So i was thinking that out
C :  Um i'm really simple
C :  Really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things are not
C :  Um
C :  And then instead of a display
C :  The display could appear on the television screen
C :  Like
C :  I guess that makes this thing
C :  Sky or cable
C :  One does like you know you press and uh and it comes up with was showing on the channel the moment and you can do you can scroll on
C :  I know so you on on the next half hour
C :  You scroll up and you see was on the other channels why are watching
C :  The same channel on the screen
C :  Uh
C :  But i lost legally taken with this
C :  Chunky plastic katie
C :  Remote
C :  Um
C :  Which is really
C :  Nice and found and get to hold and nice big easy buttons to press but still quite simple and quite cost effective
C :  So
C :  All four seasons
C :  Kind of a deal for me would be so you just have
C :  A fairly simple
C :  I mean not fancy but not too early minimalist i mean just just
C :  Pretty simple plastic
C :  Probably i was thinking yellow and black just because that's the company's colours
C :  We have
C :  Very very few buttons but that would
C :  Correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen
C :  Like you know just a small on the bottom instead of
C :  Instead of having that
C :  Ipod style
C :  Display screen on the actual remote switches five too expensive
C :  And when you've got a screen saying there in front of you you might as well have a appearing on the screen in front of you
C :  It doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching
B :  Yeah
C :  And so
C :  On that you can
C :  Just much in the same way as an existing scary remote
C :  Scroll on scroll up and down
B :  Yeah i'd say we support that idea
C :  And uh
C :  I definitely support that
C :  The use of
C :  Plastic
C :  And or rubber i mean titanium would be
C :  Great
C :  But i think it might be a bit too expensive
C :  And to
C :  "'kay" s. p. c.
C :  For training keep it
C :  Colourful and slightly organic and titanium's to
C :  Futuristic
B :  It's difficult to make fancy shapes and this is why we can't for example have a double curved
C :  Yeah
B :  Case in titanium unfortunately
C :  There's a plastic so
C :  Cheap and easy and moldable and
C :  Of the else
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh
C :  Them
B :  And e. d. u. having be the screen on the television screen i think it's a good idea "'cause" um
B :  Otherwise we were putting up the price not only for putting those in the l. c. d. and the for the electronics as well
C :  And as a little bit pointless as well i think
D :  It's a duplication
B :  That was that
C :  Like point when when you've got we've got the screen that it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little menu showing
C :  Yeah i many times one menu and you can have a different options where you wanna change the settings where the
C :  You charge information about programs on the moment
C :  I don't think that's
C :  Taxing to up
C :  It's engineer
C :  Um
C :  That's for actually
C :  I'm being do you wanna go back to the
C :  To the picture of the kitty one
C :  Okay latex it's just it's smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons are quite nicely
C :  Uh space tight so
C :  Something about like that
C :  Where
C :  Buttons arrange dunno
C :  "'kay" in a circle
C :  Up down left right it's
B :  Do you want scroll buttons and uh as well
C :  I i was saying it
C :  No i actually scroll way to like um a scroll
C :  But you know up
C :  I can try to
C :  Uh this guy that
C :  I think that you see it
C :  On the one on the right state of the buttons the most yes you're the nicest like best style thing
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Where you
C :  Have up down left and right
B :  Right
C :  And and so in the middle so you pay
C :  Your menu and then
C :  You different options and then
C :  When you click on each one make you can go into any menu for that
C :  I'm gonna but uh specific yeah
C :  Maybe we tested you something to show you thought
B :  Yeah i think i think that's
B :  Nice clean design it's going to a strength which are in pushbutton technology
D :  To um
C :  If it's a cap on the screen
D :  Mm make it
C :  I hear a right
D :  Oh nice
C :  Well
D :  Um
C :  The ipod spinning wheel is
C :  Uh really complicated
A :  Huh
C :  It does scroll point is
B :  Yeah
C :  Usually complicated
C :  Well so that that's
D :  Wow
C :  Then there
C :  Terrible
C :  But they all have this this feature of this uh
C :  It's not quite a scroll wheel
C :  But
A :  It's selection wheel
C :  It's again a selection and the circle which i think is a really good idea
B :  But we can implement it was simple push buttons
B :  Which is much cheaper
C :  Like up down left and right
C :  We did it and then and then
C :  Yeah so i mean i do a channel up and down
C :  Volume up and down
C :  Next appear programmes up and down
C :  Uhuh
C :  And then also
C :  We get the different menus on the screen it's got things like settings and contrast
A :  Okay
C :  Up and down so all you really need is these four buttons with a
C :  And then the middle
A :  Okay
C :  Um that's
B :  In fact
C :  Okay look at whistler
B :  Oh that's really nice
C :  I
C :  Almost impossible to misplace or or or lose
D :  Do you think with um
C :  Might take up your whole and we go
D :  It seems that that to you guys are quite keen on the plastic
D :  Perhaps uh something reminiscent of the child's
D :  Uh huh
D :  Do you think we could
D :  Put it in a in a fruit colour
D :  And to have an abstract yeah we could call it
C :  Possibly
D :  Like a fruit mean that would be a little bit more abstract
C :  Yeah
C :  Also possible
B :  We we could actually do it in the rubber insert a plastic if you do that
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Just
D :  Just just ran out ideas
B :  If if you if you like the spongy
A :  Or folder
A :  Are called a banana
B :  Well
A :  I have a yellow
D :  Yeah i'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract of the
D :  Design
A :  Okay
D :  Constraints or so
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh it's a something else and it to bring see uh attention
C :  It's have it
C :  Have you seen these other about this is actually the volume up and dying
A :  Uh-huh
C :  But they both say v. on them
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Which of when you first look at it
C :  You expect that to be that i mean because
B :  Yeah
C :  It looks like a timer pointing out but it's actually the v. to indicate that is the volume
A :  Yeah
C :  So
C :  Uh we do need to avoid well
C :  And be duties like this
B :  Yeah
A :  Hmm
C :  But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and then if i had in the scroll wheel then
C :  It's good yeah
C :  Double up as all the other
C :  And then functions
A :  Mm "'kay"
C :  But then that's complicated
A :  Yeah thank you for or you're
A :  Presentations
A :  We have about ten minutes left
A :  In which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts
A :  Um
A :  And she
A :  I think you all have been
A :  Cell stimulating of working together
A :  Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components
A :  Um the materials
A :  Things like
A :  Making the decision on the energy
A :  Um huh
A :  And that case
A :  And the interface type thanks
A :  So
A :  Let's
A :  Right
A :  They want us to decide
A :  What form of energy are we going to use
A :  Which the choices that we discussed
A :  Or
A :  Pretty much battery can add a course or
A :  Um
A :  This is we're kate's expert case comes the end
A :  And our decision making will be a little bit guided by taking this point
B :  I
A :  Be
A :  You were saying that they can then it would be useful
A :  That is you just have to move it's um and you'd be able to use it
A :  Um as opposed to battery you have to either put a recharger or
A :  Um take replacing the batteries
A :  Um
A :  Or solar they could have difficulty with it if it's a dark day the people dialling you in a way to do it
A :  As the day you we used the t. v.
A :  Um
A :  So what's our place your here what would be the cost consequences of each of the three
B :  One for should have been have cost information
A :  Okay
B :  You in in terms of work ability i i think be a two front runners all the standard battery or the kinetic
B :  Oh i'm sorry i don't have figures on the difference in cost
A :  Mm "'kay"
A :  What's the
A :  Oh feeling for the group on the kinetic
D :  I've used can and i can turn some watches and it's very
D :  Very yeah
D :  Handy you don't even know that's
D :  Um that's uh
C :  Saint scary i've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic sounds like it could be really good economical
D :  It's
C :  And make the whole thing a lot lighter more convenient
A :  Hmm
D :  It could tie in with a fanciful design uh it's uh
A :  Hmm
C :  Yeah
C :  "'cause" you're quite attractive far as an uh it's like
D :  Through the banana you know just gotta keep it moving
C :  Yeah
C :  It's selling points
A :  So the consensus seems to be used the kinetic if it's at all possible
C :  But does depend how much
A :  It costs
C :  I mean how much it costs and how much more developments in research and it's
A :  Mm
B :  And and how much you do have to keep it moving
A :  Mm
B :  "'cause" conscious watching t. v. can be considered said creativity
D :  But i could market that uh as a um
A :  Hmm
C :  It's a yeah it is a is a a watch on the t. v. i.
D :  That's uh
B :  Yeah
D :  Oh it
D :  I was thinking actually uh a costing me down the road in terms of battery
A :  Mm
B :  Could you have more more environmentally friendly
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah so i was thinking as well
A :  Yeah
D :  You know kind of uh
A :  Thanks for a reminder five minutes to finish thanks
A :  Um
A :  Be
A :  Next thing that they wanted us to do is look at
A :  Chip on print
A :  As a decision
B :  Oh right okay i like that but something uh maybe should have covered um
B :  Chip on print is just a manufacturing to me
A :  Well
B :  Um
B :  And i would say you recommended i think because i'm not sure i haven't done that if
A :  Okay
B :  It it's just the way that we be the uh
A :  What about the "'kay" yeah
A :  All the way we progress a lot
B :  But the way it's it's actually built and you you print on to the circuit board like you might print on the paper
A :  Oh okay
A :  Um what about the case
A :  I think they're talking there about do we what what plastic titanium or rubber and i think we've discussed not having titanium one it's too expensive
B :  I
A :  Um and second all
A :  Ooh this double um
A :  Curves
A :  Um we've sort of eliminated would say plastic or rubber what's the plan sure
B :  Well if it's a risky on the spongy feel the the rubber that we talking about is the same as you have been missiles stress balls
D :  That's exactly what i was thinking
B :  So it's
B :  Yeah
D :  I'm salt
A :  What about you
C :  I don't think it may it
C :  Like
C :  A kind of
C :  Hard plastic
C :  Inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside
C :  And then i kind of spongy
D :  Kinda like an internal think
A :  Cover
C :  Yeah us specs spongy covers it feels like the whole thing spongy that we are not damaging anything by
A :  Aha
A :  Plastic inside
C :  Squeezing it
C :  "'cause" i mean you could just get carried away with that with attack
B :  Yeah
B :  I'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible but i agree it's sounds like a nice idea if it is
C :  Yeah get that carried away with things that tactilely this one
A :  Hmm
C :  It struck them and squeeze them
D :  And with sports on television
A :  Okay
A :  Um uh the next part they want is the user interface concept um sort of pushing but we only have a couple minutes to finish up that
D :  I see
B :  I should i should
D :  Then on to say i support either from a marketing point of view i support it a decision on the design is like uh
A :  Okay and it says interface what are you can what's supplements
C :  Copy the one on the left
C :  No uh um
C :  Scroll
C :  Well like four buttons
C :  Up down left and right with enter in the middle or correspond to the menu on the screen
B :  Which i think technically is just push button and uh i said he spoke about that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're not the company the next button
C :  Yeah i'd
C :  Like push button
C :  So push buttons
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  That's a
A :  Um
A :  This is gonna sound weird but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes
A :  And i actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can look and see this as well as like an marketing they want product evaluation
C :  No it's though
D :  Yeah we can actually
C :  It's still plugged in on mine
A :  All
A :  All mine i'm sorry
D :  That's i was looking on finnish one
A :  Well okay
A :  Sorry about that that's not on
A :  Hassan be fun try to get this thing work
A :  Tara
C :  That's gonna can
B :  Yeah i think the company's it's next projection to design it has to do the hand
B :  Device
A :  Yes
B :  It's which is immediately
A :  Because i can even see mine
A :  Next meeting starts in thirty minutes these these individual actions you're right
C :  Ah yes
A :  Um
A :  The look-and-feel design
A :  It is for kate
A :  A staff gets the user interface design you get product
A :  In evaluation
A :  Um the two of you have to play with the play-doh modelling clay
A :  Um to do a prototype
A :  Uh
A :  And everybody gets and veg constructions in the usual way
D :  Sounds good
A :  Anything else we need to do
C :  Right
A :  Good to work
C :  Surely
A :  Yeah that's the end of this meeting
A :  That's for her benefit
D :  That's really all it
