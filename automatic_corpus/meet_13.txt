A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Record
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So the project method is the following
A :  So the form of um uh the u. functional design you have to do on any individual work
A :  And
A :  Um also work with um mm meetings
A :  Talking with each other
A :  Um it will be the same for the conceptual design and uh-huh
A :  Also the same for the detailed design
A :  Um uh mm
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Tool training is to try out the white board
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So
C :  And some of that would desire but uh-huh
A :  Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
A :  And uh-huh
D :  So right now

C :  I
A :  Remote comes from controls try to create something new and people would like to
A :  To buy uh-huh
A :  Um oh and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes

A :  So you're right
A :  All have your mm
A :  Specific specific role and
A :  You know i suppose in a watch you have to do that
C :  But
A :  And so um mm
A :  You will have to work on the design and also
A :  To work on them
A :  Design of the technical from the functions of the remote control
A :  And i think of the um user requirement specifications
D :  Those things just referred for each of each of us
D :  I think any and
A :  Yep
A :  Idea
A :  So
C :  I. d.s for the industry designer
D :  Okay
C :  And u. i. d. for the user interface design yeah
B :  With me
D :  Okay and marketing expert that's me
C :  Yeah
C :  And me
A :  So i will match all the group
C :  Do you think the much
D :  To to manage well this yeah
A :  Hmmm so you have questions
D :  Um
D :  Oh really
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So you all know what's the parts of the work you have to do
D :  So which you will the industrial designer
B :  No i'm really is um user interface do that
C :  I am is in the city than
A :  Uh-huh
A :  And you
C :  I am the end city than mm mm
A :  Okay
B :  Okay
B :  So what's the difference between
A :  Uh-huh
B :  User interface design to
D :  I mean you have to know
B :  Yeah that's a design
D :  Oh yeah
A :  No
C :  It's difficult
D :  It's your job so i hope you you know where it is
C :  You know very superficial
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
B :  I think so
A :  Space you have to design it's and you have to take care of thing
A :  Industrial wages for me
B :  Okay so i make uh you user interface
B :  You
A :  Any maybe you will just one it's
B :  You you the minutes of call functions
C :  I i think they use it for the user interface design use your design how the user mean you use it is in between the user and it was a real opposed to
B :  Use it
B :  Make make yeah
C :  And the in the city than it is house a object we look like
B :  Maybe i think the oath
C :  It was a much
B :  To design so
B :  It's a function these
B :  I designed the use of user interface you do that the function
A :  Maybe just the else i need slide
D :  Okay
C :  Okay but i was thinking that that you the user "'cause" the user interface to design for example or as it would but it would be you know
B :  Okay
B :  Yeah
C :  But i don't know i look at
D :  Well you know
C :  I am the industrial designer

D :  Yeah i'm just gonna i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done um
A :  Uh-huh
D :  What the users would like to have
A :  And yeah
D :  And then do this with uh i guess can watch tool would be
D :  User interface design know and then industrial designer
C :  Okay
A :  And when designing u. v. remote control just remember that so it has to be
A :  Kind of international product
A :  So you don't have to do something really specific
B :  Uh-huh
A :  As every t. everybody will have to use it as the same as keyboards
A :  You know you have quality as a t. v. french and u. k. keyboard
A :  So you really the remote control to be
A :  International
B :  Okay
A :  And not too expensive
B :  Yeah and the simple
A :  As we want to maximise the benefits
B :  I t. v. to use
D :  And you have to keep it under twelve euros and
C :  Thank you

D :  Fifty so
D :  That's the problem
C :  It should be a
A :  But but the cost want to be max uh-huh more than twelve
A :  But fifty euros
B :  Okay
A :  And to be sure that's really people would be interested in buying
A :  Any remote control with maybe a new functionality is that
A :  Don't exist in
A :  The um
A :  Existing remote controls now
B :  Okay sure
A :  Same is it okay
D :  Uh-huh
D :  It's clear
