D :  I
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Mm
A :  Okay good morning everybody um i'm glad you can come and really set aside esteem
A :  Um i'm just gonna have a powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting
A :  My name is rose and then i'll be the project manager
A :  Um are done is a is we're gonna do a little opening and then um i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project
D :  Uh-huh
A :  The whole thing to acquaint and such a strange know each other little bit
A :  Including a tool training exercise
A :  Uh nor moving to the project plan to little discussion in close as we only have twenty five minutes uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  First of all our project aim um we're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original trendy and user-friendly
A :  I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
A :  Um
A :  So we're gonna define this up in the three uh
A :  Compact three parts first the functional design which will be
A :  Um for so do individual work um into a meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting
A :  And then the detailed design individual work and a meeting
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So the what you need to be doing our own ideas might come together and
A :  Um
A :  Collaborating
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay we're gonna get snow it a little bit uh-huh
A :  So um we're gonna do is start off with um
A :  Let's start off with the me now um only my sorry only one
B :  Okay
A :  Um we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work that whiteboard behind yeah
B :  I
A :  A introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then try your favourite animal what else about it
B :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  I don't know which one of these i have to bring with me
A :  Probably both
B :  Mm
B :  Right so and so's to draw my favourite animal i have no drawing skills whatsoever
B :  But uh alessi introduce myself my name is uh we not pretending a um
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm
B :  I'm from
B :  The state of maine in the u. s. and doing a show them studies
B :  Well upon have an artistic talents
A :  I sat in a uh-huh
B :  A l. i n. a.
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer
B :  On this project
B :  So let's see if i can get
D :  Mm
B :  Um here
B :  I'll draw a little
B :  Turtle for you all huh
D :  Um
B :  Not necessarily "'cause" it's i have a solution favourite animal but is that
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I think the trouble
B :  You have a pretty little shell going on

A :  So what your favourite characteristics
B :  Um i i like the whole have in the shelf thing
A :  Hmm
B :  It's
B :  Quite cool okay your home around or you go on
B :  Quite tech rid of oh animals they can split they can
B :  They're very adaptable
B :  Pick a everything they need with that
B :  Um
B :  And they're easy to draw
A :  Excellent
A :  So just go round table
C :  Ah okay well
C :  My name's yeah
C :  Ah
C :  And i'm the user interface designer for the project
C :  And
C :  Try and for my favourite animal
C :  Oh i should do that one i should
B :  Yeah you can erase that it'll it'll right
C :  Right
C :  I was a little bit off
A :  Might be nice to have them all at the same time
C :  Um
C :  I'm not gonna draw it quite a scare
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Is that at least identify with
D :  Some way out
A :  And
C :  It a one yeah
B :  Where is the
C :  I
D :  Format so that when i'm a very old
B :  So i
C :  Um and yeah there is no like well this "'cause" um that
C :  Well first of all the quite intelligent um
C :  And also the the kind of mysterious
C :  We don't really know much about them all
C :  On the stand out that work for groups
D :  Uh-huh
C :  It's fun and interesting animal
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay attractive to me
D :  Alright and jesse on um
D :  Around d. c. h. sort of thing and you lapse
D :  And we're gonna keep a t. c. sort of thing or not
D :  That animals
D :  Uh-huh
D :  I don't know how it wrong but i have
D :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Yep into the water
D :  How
D :  It's more uh give an i. t. r.
D :  I have no idea how one would explain uh
D :  It's an whiskers
D :  Basically it supposed to be a feel
A :  Uh-huh
D :  You can that in in the water i like that um take five
D :  So like a four and i'll use whatever
D :  A good time
D :  I'm gonna try and for some make it can get any better than that
D :  I
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm "'kay"
A :  Uh-huh okay i'm rose and and project manager uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  From california
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um mm uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh i i
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh uh mm
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So i
A :  I
D :  It's doubtful a signal gonna be harder wondered you wanna uh-huh
B :  Oh okay
A :  I was actually really let's see
B :  Right
A :  I give it a little bit of snout had no teeth
D :  That's impressive
A :  Yeah
B :  That's pretty impressive
B :  Mm
A :  Oh dear
A :  Yes i have it on
A :  And a very costly for the open space and off and we have coyotes how old i am
A :  So i really enjoy there
A :  I was thinking in a really beautiful animal has an eye mm
A :  Okay um moving on to
A :  Slightly more serious stuff
D :  Uh-huh
A :  It at a project finance is um with a couple uh-huh
A :  I would like to sell it for about twenty five euro um uh with a profit aim of
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um fifty million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it uh it would market range of the internet like it's in international market range we do have to worry about specifics
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  In order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve
A :  Fifty euro uh-huh
A :  So we're selling it for twice what would like to use it or uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay um
A :  Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um could have like to you by your experiences using rubber remote controls
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um your first ideas about um creating a new remote control would be the best
A :  Um the way you would have the features that you really like what features that you don't like
A :  Etcetera so um
D :  Um okay when there's like
D :  Welcome but then you have to pass to uh
D :  Actually train on the t. v. like you have to do one for the power the t. v. in um like
A :  Uh-huh
D :  No the one to get actual screen own and many of their logo i know i don't know now we keep combining
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
D :  All different
D :  Remotes together on a on a plate
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Necessarily like max of the trend up
D :  To multimedia overload could just wanna watch the t. v.
A :  Hmm
D :  Um
D :  With the cost them sort of like
D :  Device to help you find that
C :  I've used
C :  I do use remote controls things like
C :  T. v. and the c. d. player and
C :  Video recorder
C :  And
C :  Oh i guess that that pretty neat
C :  All tools uh you don't have to
C :  Get up and
C :  "'cause" i mean to change the channel
A :  Mm
C :  So especially if you're someone really lazy like mean the
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Um
C :  A fine then they can be a bit annoying especially
C :  I know if i'm watching t. v. i have
D :  Uh-huh
C :  After three separate remote controls
A :  Uh-huh
C :  The front of me you know one for the t. v. one for the digital box
C :  One for the video recorder as well
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Um
C :  And also evidence uh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  They tend to be a bit confusing that
C :  Too many buttons on them
C :  Um
D :  Uh-huh
C :  To sort of
C :  Of complicated supply and
C :  Well i really wanna do is
D :  Uh-huh
C :  So on and off change the channel change the volume
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah um
B :  I agree with
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Having too many remotes around my dad has a whole drawer
B :  At home of remotes for various things i don't know how to work half of them
B :  Um
B :  What's important for me
B :  I guess is that it's easy to use
B :  And
D :  Uh-huh
B :  There's not too many buttons are not too small you know
D :  Uh-huh
B :  No you needing to know what you're doing
B :  And one thing i particularly like is
D :  Uh-huh
B :  If you're not um strive moving it around to get it to work with the infrared
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
B :  Um i think there's a way around that
B :  But i know it in my residence right now that
B :  The television you should have to walk all around the room together to turn on so it's just simpler
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Just to just turn on the t. v. itself and i think that's
B :  If we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
D :  Uh-huh about like batteries and things like that like either some remotes that all the dark where
D :  Like batteries are to warm up to our brothers
A :  Um how much all of them but we could
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  But also we could use like a lithium battery um
B :  Yeah something that doesn't
A :  That would last longer than like double a. is um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Like that does of the batteries they're used in a lot of um three players now on a kind of thing
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  Okay seems a little bit of a complex over um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Did combining all the remotes can together versus having
D :  Uh-huh
A :  By different remotes
A :  So um
A :  Like you say you don't like having all the buttons on one
A :  On one remote and yeah you don't wanna have five remotes
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Mm mm
A :  So how do we work with that mm
B :  Yeah
B :  Could we get something that
B :  Just has
D :  Uh-huh
B :  You know doesn't have all the buttons that you need to programme the video recorder or
B :  Programme it's other things that i'm not
B :  A coherent about
B :  But that just has your major buttons
B :  For that work for everything you know volume control
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  On off
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Channel changing
D :  Maybe that's spatial a divided so it's like if your body if you're trying to get the t. v. on that's not the top banana remote i don't have a beep or a corporate an hour
D :  In terms of how we're gonna make it but if it's like all the t. v. status here are the non p. c. r. suppose you're all the
D :  Whatever else you know programmed into it it's all just ended the place and not like all the on button see a doctor know like i don't even know what i'm trained on
A :  Yeah
B :  No way
A :  Mm
B :  Yeah and if um
B :  If it's if the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes
D :  Uh-huh
B :  That you would need to use every day
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main function of the on off channel changing volume
A :  I'm not the right remote with all the special things because that is one thing that um
A :  Remotes ten to have buttons that the t. v.s no longer have as well
B :  Mm
A :  So like you have to have some some work as you can um we need a special functions occasionally
B :  Right
A :  Um
A :  But
A :  I'm still a lot of them that normal remote
C :  Can i ask are we
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Designing a remote control for television only
A :  Good question
C :  Um
C :  I mean if
C :  This device is just to be used for the television
C :  Would leave and technically be possible to ensure
D :  Uh-huh
C :  A record of functions on that
A :  I don't know that yet
C :  Um or should we just stick to
C :  To stick to having
C :  Television
C :  Television like that
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Good question um
D :  Okay yeah
A :  A look into it
A :  Okay
D :  I think it's just t. v. mean if it
D :  For taking it
D :  That's right that's that
A :  Uh-huh
D :  New product a new television remote control it's not like that
D :  Doesn't say
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh know i think might be more advanced that
A :  Hmm
C :  So we should
C :  Maybe we should assume that a two
C :  Just a television that we want to control
C :  Well
C :  I mean i suppose it would be nice to have
C :  Play in the court and stop buttons on a video recorder as well
C :  I don't know if uh
C :  Technologically or not
B :  Yes i guess we have to define what
B :  Or aiming for
B :  If it's just a television on that
B :  It's a bit simpler to show us buttons that would even need to be on it
D :  It's an idea of the buttons being the or um
B :  Large
D :  Yeah
B :  If you have older people or people like me that are fake court needed hand i
B :  It's really quite important that you're not pressing a small
A :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Teeny mobile phones size buttons
B :  If we can help it
A :  Mm
A :  Okay sounds like we've had a good little session for our first ideas mind if we move on
D :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  Our next meeting starts in thirty minutes
A :  They've they've actually but only working on this this one for about twenty so we continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  But
A :  It's just a breakdown of what will be doing individually um the industrial design only now we we doing on the working design
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  User interface designer that's real that so
A :  Technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons
D :  Uh-huh
A :  I'm user requirements
A :  Um
A :  So do we hearing about different runs how about different things that people need
A :  Um i guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having will get from the actual concern is consumers
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay um
A :  And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realised in this past when we we didn't have much we just wanted to
A :  Oh brainstorming done a hmm
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So
A :  Very excited to see our animals
A :  And how what wonderful um are the cellar
D :  Uh-huh
A :  I
A :  Um
A :  Any questions
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Are we gonna be discussing and the next meeting
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Do we know
A :  I haven't gotten an agenda yeah it's um i'll put that together
A :  I'm sure as well each get around instructions and then um
A :  Because what we're gonna do is first are individual actions and then we'll come back together
A :  So um
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay
A :  Sure we'll have more concrete things to continue next time
B :  She would be to see
A :  Okay um
A :  Okay but maybe minutes and probably numbers that are all of you know
A :  Um just including all the things that we talked about a
A :  Um
C :  Can you email your slides as well
C :  Is that
A :  Yeah said yes i think again
A :  I'll just attach it to you know
A :  And you're you're number two
B :  And two
A :  Three for that right
D :  Mm four
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Right
A :  That's lovely meeting um
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  To make sure you keep checking company less any emails
D :  Uh-huh
A :  It's it's written yeah
