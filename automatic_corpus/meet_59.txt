A :  Mm
A :  Mm
A :  Part of it or
D :  Hmm
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Okay
C :  This is a final meeting a
C :  Detailed design meeting
C :  And
C :  Again all
C :  Take minutes to
C :  What we have to get through in this meeting it is
C :  Firstly
C :  The prototype presentation for me too
C :  So you can shows what you've been working on
D :  Yeah
C :  So diligently
C :  Um then
B :  It does i'm like cool
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah yeah i think acts going to
C :  Present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be
C :  Evaluating this against
C :  Then i need to say since
C :  Few things about finance "'cause" we have to check that
C :  It's within the finance
C :  Criteria
C :  Um and then we'll be
C :  Making sure that
C :  Our product fixed price the evaluation criteria from cat and uh
C :  Financial limit
C :  Um and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of
C :  Production and design
C :  We've been through so we've got forty minutes
B :  And then then we get to make the right one
C :  Yeah yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Because we we nice to know
B :  Yeah
C :  So
C :  It's now i guess that was the start it
C :  In thirty five
C :  So we've got and so
C :  Four
C :  Jane
A :  No
C :  Right
A :  How how much do we have forty minutes
D :  Yeah well for fifteen yeah
C :  Yeah until about four fifteen so
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay so
C :  Therefore do you want
D :  So is that um
D :  Oh are we starting with the the
C :  Yes
A :  Wasn't it
D :  So we you maybe start was like the in the shape and things and
D :  And then i will explain be the user interface
D :  So any of things like the buttons and the scrolling thing
A :  Okay
A :  Okay so uh basically going with that kind of vegetables and uh i do we selected colour
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And approximate shape of a banana
C :  Uh-huh i
B :  Okay
A :  I
A :  Um mm
B :  You think we're not as as a thing to use of it
B :  Chronic
A :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
D :  Well but it's it's just not approximation uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Do you expect it yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Do we expect that to
A :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  But you're a control or
B :  Uh this is about uh
C :  I
C :  There's a vibrate when you press the button
A :  Yeah
C :  Sorry sorry
A :  Um so basically so is the flip open thing that can
C :  Uh-huh
A :  So and uh oh we we have the okay so what michael will explain you are user interface there
A :  And it flips up on the side
A :  So it opens like that
C :  Uh-huh
A :  And we have the user interface
C :  Oh
A :  Oh in here and uh uh uh uh um the the l. c. d. and uh the scroller inside
A :  Um
A :  Well everything else is probably user interface so
D :  Uh yeah
C :  And that's the whole thing's made of rubber is that
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Or a pear
A :  Oh yeah yeah it is yeah
D :  Yeah it it
B :  Is it's a scale a d. v. make a bit smaller
D :  And it's gonna make a bit smaller and and of course it would be shiny and it yet but uh one thing we actually kind of
B :  Mm
D :  Um for court one designing it once i was supposed to be round this or is it the backside round yeah
A :  Yeah well the way since it's made of rubber anywhere
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Well i i think it's it's uh
D :  Yeah
B :  It there's a lot of fun it's like having and then the whole shapes kind of these i would say that it's
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Have a look quite like a vegetable
D :  Yeah
A :  Oh
D :  And it's spongy s. i.
C :  Yeah yeah yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  A little like you don't have it
D :  Say
D :  I
D :  So at the user interface as as we discussed last time
D :  Uh work on on the um
D :  On the colour we just have the very basic things so we have that yeah it channel see a starting from um
C :  Uh-huh
D :  And one two three uh that would be numbers seen in the on the actual one
C :  Yeah
D :  So uh it's for
D :  Up to four up to seven up to nine and zero
C :  Seven eight nine
C :  I don't that
D :  They are here yeah
D :  And then well this is on off button it's it's quite standard
D :  In place for it and uh and also the call a squeezable from rate so it's it's kind of user friendly and then this one's would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one and then we would also have a little um saying saying chip representing prevent prevent next
C :  Yeah
C :  Uh huh
B :  So what is the volume
C :  Yeah
D :  The volume is is scrolling on the side this one you just do it like this and and and it's it's on the back is um a cover more back
A :  It's on the side
B :  Uh uday get that and uh
B :  Yeah
D :  Later because
D :  If you flip it open you can still do the scrolling yeah
B :  R. i. k. can link
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Say
D :  So the volume is you you just scroll but then once you flip it open
D :  Okay they they have the screen
C :  Yep
D :  And and you have a dumb spinning wheel was options to choose can go back and forth and then if you needed into something on the screen you just push the cent in the middle button
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Cool all the thing we forgot was like a mute button
D :  Any button
B :  Yeah
A :  Hmm mm no we we gonna put that in that sense
D :  What what we will have this on the screen on the display
A :  What what
A :  Uh so on on the cover we have a little bear essentials
C :  Or you could have it so you know on the wheel if you
B :  Oh no we own like if you hold are we all down then it will
C :  Mm yeah
A :  The uh on the l. c. d. with uh you know the main menu will have a these options
B :  Yep
D :  Well but that but to me it yeah but the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right
C :  But if you hold it in
B :  Yeah basis calling to make isn't it
C :  If it's a scrolling click so you hold it in
D :  Okay yeah yeah okay
B :  I like a cool so that's uh that's also whole meeting she
D :  Yeah
D :  And okay so the so the all the voice recognition is also
D :  Just ball to it you can't really see it in the interface
C :  No
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah it's hidden in there somewhere
D :  And we do have the logo
D :  And that's
C :  Uh-huh very good
D :  So i think
C :  And that's it it with the the black and yellow your even in the right colour
D :  Yeah
B :  Safe yeah
D :  Yeah i think it um we could do the logo in grey
A :  Cool
C :  Uh-huh
D :  As it is on the website
B :  Yeah
D :  And the actual one
A :  We eat out of resources or so
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah yeah yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  So if you have questions
A :  You can have a look
C :  "'kay" to the
C :  Tested out
A :  Mm
D :  I
A :  Yeah "'kay"
B :  Okay cat
C :  I
A :  Yeah "'kay"
C :  Yeah it's a sort of intermediate colour i guess
B :  Yeah well
B :  You know the moment
B :  It is you know
A :  Mm
B :  Call them slimy
C :  Yeah
B :  I hate today's just mean
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah well that's cool
C :  Very cool okay so maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria and then we'll
B :  A. j.
C :  But i suspect we're gonna have a couple of mine a finance issue is that um we'll say oh i'm sure we can get around them somewhere
A :  Yeah see the budget
A :  Mm
C :  We just
C :  Send all of our manufacturing to
C :  Some last paul country
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So the process that way
B :  Whales
C :  Labels for example
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Mm cool okay
B :  "'kay"
B :  Mm mm
B :  Fabulous
C :  Marketing expert
B :  Yeah
B :  Okay you can tell you what we get d. is prefer to put had the evaluation of the new design
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Um sorry an easy a seven point scale say you wanna is in a yes it a team each one a requirement
B :  And seven is no you really doesn't we need to get back and start again
B :  Um you need
B :  Basically what i did was i went to
B :  Although like user requirements and things that we've done
B :  And we've worked on and like a made a list of them um
B :  Yeah i see that we can really each one and like she's are going back to the store and saying oh yeah we did marry speed or i mean are you ready for
D :  Yeah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay cool say these what they are
C :  So if each of these we need to give it a one to seven right
B :  Yes i did have a p. c. and easy on here but it seems to turn into
B :  Right just one point
C :  And box never mind
B :  Okay if you can imagine that they say a. b. c. and d.
B :  That would be really did
A :  Yes we do with my some points and everything yeah yeah
D :  Yeah the yeah it's definitely attractive
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah i agree
D :  Of the locator ball thing we actually from well
B :  Well i thought you need some kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t. v.
D :  Yeah so i just prepared no
C :  Yeah
C :  Just prepare one uh huh
D :  That would be rates yeah
B :  Cool
B :  Okay
B :  So i be attractive to look at
B :  That's this one
B :  What you're saying
C :  I reckon it
D :  So seven was in the maximum yeah
A :  So
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  I i go for seven
C :  Seven yeah it's terribly sexy
B :  Oh yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Well so you have the colour take a say that a break
C :  Yeah
B :  A seven i i
B :  "'kay" it on a home also said that
B :  It a um are what i've done on the next page is our setup so we just put them all same
C :  Uh okay
A :  Okay
C :  Excellent
C :  Except we can't
B :  Yeah but that's alright if you take in a rough and then all of them and
C :  Or we can do it
A :  Well we can we can i get i can take notes uh
C :  Then yeah i'll take a nice that's fine
B :  Okay say it were all agreeing on seventh day
C :  Yeah
B :  Call it a does it match the operating behaviour of the user
D :  I would think yes yeah
C :  I think it does
A :  Um
B :  Yeah
B :  I mean
A :  He the only thing that we were considering was that um
A :  This thing is kind of more for right-handed people than left-handed people say if you're left-handed
A :  That kind of that uh scrolling with your finger
D :  Yeah so you so when we might do we might want to do like that but none of them a model of the look another version which is like exactly the mere a mentioned this one
C :  Um right
B :  Yeah
C :  That's gonna be a problem "'cause" you don't always have all left hand is all right-handers in a family
A :  But that yeah
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah
B :  I think i think it's not
A :  No but it's it's not a huge problem because eh it is a credible
B :  It's not like it's up and
D :  But then uh then uh i think left-handed people already use the discrimination anyway so they just
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah but i mean because it's not like it's a pen you know left-handed people can we why why handed they can we do make things right handed say
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Mm right
B :  I'd say is not such a big issue you
D :  Yeah because i mean anyway irritate people would be able to scroll wheels and so it it's the majority a right-handed it's yeah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  I mean you can you can use your finger uh to to scroll one and your thumb
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  Say i mean that was kind of negate the whole r. s. i. a. she say maybe we need for that means a little bit investigation maybe give it a five hours a a cheap what you think
A :  No
C :  Open
D :  Or maybe sakes because it's just one money in one um on the issue i mean yeah
C :  Yeah i think i think for um i mean most people or right handed so
C :  In
C :  In terms of our greatest target group i think it's pretty good but we might want to fly get from management they want might want to um
D :  Yeah
A :  One nothing is a
B :  Okay
C :  That
A :  It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens and the side
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh yeah but yeah but we have it's it nicely with the hinges c. more was so what's that yeah
A :  So on
A :  Yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  So it won't be a problem it would be and it would be it won't be handy
A :  So you guys can decide whether
B :  Add anything else and to this within from the top
D :  Yeah well yeah but it's it's a bit long it's a little bit long
A :  Yeah but we which makes it kind of are really
C :  The length it's gonna be different
B :  Yeah um
D :  Well i mean it can be open like a base of course and yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  But you were thinking about making it smaller yeah
C :  Hmm
B :  Because
A :  Uh this this kind of that makes more and and do it might interfere with a i. r. channel
D :  It's a slightly smaller
B :  So you have to keep
B :  Side flat
D :  Yeah but before flip it open only as much as that
A :  Okay
B :  So it works like a mobile phone flipping but you know as long as that's that's that then that one
A :  Right
B :  Okay
A :  Okay
B :  Um oh okay say
B :  See
B :  Oh oh we admitting defeat and say oh we say we're gonna stick in my case on the t. v.
C :  That we're gonna put a like we got that there's the locator
A :  No we have uh locator
B :  There's like a to close to them easy to
D :  Mm that you stick on t. v.
C :  Hmm
B :  That is mean you need a little speaker on the way
B :  Tonight
B :  To make it beep
D :  Yeah well well but the but the speech sample speaker using to do so it it has some look at the system to do
B :  Or was that
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Something to make some sound so yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  It's a
B :  That's true so that so then yeah it's like a total
D :  Yep
B :  Fabulous
B :  They
A :  Thank you to complete into to
C :  I
B :  I at
D :  Yeah
D :  If i if if this means it's easier if it means the way people kind of i used to finding things and it's five
C :  Yeah
D :  I think it's
C :  So it's six "'cause"
C :  But i mean the the standard layout for numbers it is three three three um one rather than the wave got it i really like the way you have it but it's not the immediate thing that you used to
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  And it yeah
B :  Yeah and i mean
A :  And uh even the scroll it sits in your technology so my my might be a little more difficult for people to get used in the biggest oh it is kind of not very intuitive
C :  Might be
A :  But uh it's a good technology i mean once they get used to
C :  But it and it's something that they will be experiencing a lot of different places and
D :  Yeah
B :  So they should be maybe save f. i. even say is intuitive but it's different say you
A :  So that
C :  Five
C :  Yeah
B :  J. i mean is always have to use it be marked to think about it uh so we do that on a five you think
A :  Yeah
C :  I'm happy with that
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay i'm gonna give a seven and everything so that the
C :  Yeah i
B :  I'm battery setting this to have taken a little while i do that
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Um intuitive
B :  But it's
B :  So is really hard to live on this this went a bit mad to know
C :  Yeah
B :  Um it a cool eighty
B :  Eight eight
B :  Um
B :  I guess this comes back from this whole be thing links in there
B :  Say it
B :  Possibly for left and that's
B :  Investigate
C :  Yeah
C :  But otherwise it's cheap the the
B :  Say she give it a set
B :  Six
D :  Um uh the atomic ergonomic design well
D :  And
D :  I mean yeah i'd uh i dunno i mean that the repetitive stress things but then we would be you're really pushing the buttons so much on uh
D :  On the remote control anyway yeah so yeah
A :  Yes
A :  Mm yeah yeah unless you're all the time sitting
D :  Yeah so it's kinda
C :  A week and then from
B :  I used to send fifty text a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that's our find it quite hard to believe c. n. s.
A :  Yeah i i think it is a dummy
C :  Yeah
A :  Mm
A :  And moreover it it has a um l. c. d. and everything so that uh you know my we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah it's a very good
B :  Okay say we give it a six yeah
C :  Six
B :  A k. e. f.
D :  Yeah how was it does have four yeah
C :  Voice control have a seven uh
B :  Oh not showing up at the things that are there any of the points that
C :  Ah that's the second one so you must to change it on the somewhere it's got school
C :  But not on the previous slide
B :  Oh okay cool
B :  Um
B :  Well i'd say
A :  Absolutely
A :  It has voice control
B :  Yes that's a seven and
B :  Um
C :  Gee
D :  Technology yeah oh well
C :  Technologically innovative
A :  You know it yeah
A :  Yeah it's the most sophisticated more to uh we're seen
B :  I
D :  Yeah
C :  I
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Okay
C :  But in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually in you
D :  Well we have uh we'll have the sample speaker as well which is yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah but i mean you doing
D :  Mm yeah
C :  All of the components of being used in other things before
D :  But uh the same time they all they all relatively new
A :  Yeah but they have been brought together in a remote
B :  They've never been used
C :  But do you yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  And i mean you know a remote control will for evening
C :  Yeah
B :  He is
C :  Well you reckon five six
B :  Yeah but do you think
D :  Six
B :  Six
D :  I mean how how far can you go with a remote control really
B :  Well that's a i mean
D :  It still has to do what you want it has to do
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah but i mean every think it's been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasn't it's a
C :  Yeah
B :  And maybe three
C :  Based remote
D :  Yeah
B :  Is that we can take your that
C :  Put fashion in electronics
D :  Yeah isn't it has no yeah sure
A :  Absolutely yeah yeah
A :  The cat banana
D :  It's not maximum fashion
B :  Say we give a seven i'm right
A :  The remote yeah yeah
D :  Fruit fruits and vegetables well fashionable these days uh
B :  Okay
D :  So i think we've done very well but
A :  Mm
A :  I think that's us
B :  Cool
C :  Very good
D :  That's me assessment
B :  Say we need the average here this to us
D :  Every she's about six and something
C :  Yeah
D :  A little bit or six
C :  Well um
B :  Seven
C :  Once and
A :  There are only six is one two
D :  No wait a little bit on the six no wait
B :  So you've got four seven to say that's twenty eight
B :  Three six is
A :  And one five
B :  Eighteen
D :  I'll say six is okay yeah
C :  If you and one two three four five six seven eight
A :  Twenty eight thirty eight
D :  For some buttons
A :  Forty six
A :  Okay six and five fifty one fifty one divided by
C :  Six point
D :  Six point something yeah
C :  Fine
C :  That six point five
D :  Six point five
C :  Close enough
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay that's pretty good i think
C :  Now wait until we get to find them for the most
B :  If if if it
C :  If we can afford it
C :  That so you've got them a word did you have anything more
B :  Um
B :  Right that's it yeah
C :  That's it
C :  Well
C :  So the finance
C :  Um also we if we can
C :  Unscrew this yes
C :  Sorry this is um just um
B :  Okay
B :  Uh yeah and then them up
C :  Beautiful
C :  Not anymore
D :  Uh-huh
C :  No signal
A :  Mm
A :  I mean if you have to wait one
C :  Mm
C :  Yeah
C :  Okay so we've looked at the prototype presentation i mean valuation criteria
C :  And
C :  Now we have to calculate the production cost
C :  So i got an excel spreadsheet
C :  To help us do that so
C :  Can you read that
C :  Almost
C :  Well less
C :  Um i started feeling a team
C :  But it's
C :  Of course is a provisional so we have to go down
C :  No a hand dynamo right
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  One simple battery
C :  No the kinetic
C :  Energy know so uh huh
C :  The chip we going for an
C :  Advanced chip on print
A :  Advanced yeah
C :  We also set the sample sensor and sample speaker
D :  Yep
C :  Um single curved
C :  Surface so that we can hold it
D :  Yeah
D :  Yes
C :  Case material we said rubber
D :  Right yeah
C :  I don't know what special colour means
A :  Mm
A :  And i think uh i think uh which is not more common
D :  I don't think uh leds yeah probably so i think this is probably a special colour know
C :  It could be
B :  Yeah but well that comes calendars in a in a
C :  Rubber rubber comes colours it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured all wood coloured that's different
D :  Yeah
D :  Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern of thing and uh yeah yeah okay
C :  Yeah let's leave it is zero "'cause" it's easy
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah you might end up having to take off d.
C :  We we definitely going to have to
D :  I have pushbuttons
C :  So we got push button and them
B :  Sample sensor
D :  Scroll where have scroll wheel as well
C :  Scroll wheel with push button we had no
C :  For the meeting yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah oh yeah we had before meeting yeah
A :  No uh we we have to yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  And we have l. c. display and yeah
C :  And
C :  Button supplements
D :  Um
B :  Right
A :  Yeah
C :  No
A :  No we don't know we're not using any of the
C :  No
D :  Yeah but do we do we have will have l. c. display but the but the wall
C :  But the the spinning wheels not yeah i have
D :  But that was spinning wheel yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Maybe it's integrated with the l. c. display
D :  Okay let's say see
B :  We've got more than one pushbutton no way
D :  Yeah
C :  I think the pushbutton oh
B :  But then you have
C :  I don't know if that's one
B :  That means you can only have twenty five pushbuttons in terms of the net not counting anything
C :  Yeah
B :  So been but it
C :  That seems unlikely
A :  Wall what is the moment
C :  Um with the with the push button means that
B :  Twelve point five
D :  We have to count all the more yeah
C :  Count by by show or do we go i don't think that makes sense
A :  Mm i don't think so
B :  No it what it is and that it was
A :  No it says what what is the kind of interface if it is push button then you get a zero point five it's a scroll-wheel so we we've put a it's push button and a scroll wheel
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  And the l. c. is uh
A :  An l. c. d. display
C :  Yeah
A :  So that's that's a three kind of interfaces that we have
C :  Yeah
C :  So it as we can see that's way too expensive to hand yeah
A :  What what what's our take it yeah
B :  This sample sensor uh
C :  Our budget
C :  Twelve point five
B :  Yeah the sample sensor will have to go a "'cause" that's the most expensive thing on the
A :  Um okay
C :  Yeah
C :  So
C :  That has implications for for d.
C :  Speak a
A :  Yeah it does not have for voice recognition where does have for the feedback speaker
B :  Yeah
A :  Then when you say when you press one it says one uh or it says hollow
C :  For the locator
B :  But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really is no you can afford to go to that
C :  Yeah
A :  And the locator also go away
D :  But it was a very not innovative and then
C :  Yeah
D :  In a way innovativeness well there
B :  So that means made okay to do that
D :  Well i am
D :  Yeah
B :  I mean it is
C :  What else does it need
D :  Well this
D :  P. k. and assumptions be case it's expensive but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps
C :  Yeah "'cause" the sample speaker was i think more complicated than just to be changing
D :  So they
D :  Yeah yeah yeah in there you record your samples your speech and that's and
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Okay so
A :  Also a in that case i'm not sure that you uh evaluate this as a corpus of this because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber or i mean
C :  Aha
B :  Okay yeah
A :  Um yeah
C :  Right so we need one fifty or
B :  See i was gonna say the scroll-wheel pushbutton think
B :  "'cause"
C :  Take it down to just a scroll wheel
C :  We could do
A :  Um
A :  So that i mean that we can have pressed how do we how to make a selection uh in a in a l. c. d.
D :  Yeah then then we would be in a book by choose
A :  If it in the l. c. d. we can scroll right how do we make a selection if you do cannot push the button
D :  You know and and you can push this one but we don't have a
D :  A pushbutton i would we don't have this meeting mechanism for the scrolling thing
B :  But that's
C :  Yeah
B :  Well you just have to to split it down a
C :  You can have to scroll it straight to roll it straight down uh from you
D :  Mm
B :  So that's point three
A :  No what what
A :  But it it's it's a scroll-wheel um i thought we would have into this as a scroll wheel spinning wheel and push button thing
D :  But i mean if we can put an addition mute button on that's all possible
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah i mean that would actually cost anymore that's a spinning wheel though isn't it than that come with the l. c.
C :  That's with the l. c.
A :  That comes with the l. c. d.
B :  Yeah
C :  We decided "'cause" it's not on a list
B :  Yeah
A :  Oh so so the the this is
C :  The scroll wheel is on the side
A :  Right
A :  So we are adding costs for both oh right okay uh i mean i mean
A :  That's a good
D :  So
B :  So the point for yeah yeah
C :  One point three uh for the moment
C :  Okay mm
B :  Unless we just take off the scroll wheel together in just a push buttons for volume
B :  Can still put them on the side
B :  Uh yeah i mean the scroll wheels pretty cool but
C :  Yeah i have
A :  Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons there are four up and down
B :  Yeah
D :  Mm
B :  Yeah
A :  I was saying that sounds good actually yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay yeah
C :  Rather than having three different things that people have to do
D :  Okay
A :  Do it but
C :  There we go out a look where why and the budget know make huge profits and we'll get bonuses
B :  Or we could admit to the single curve in a set of it
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  I
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Or or that we have to have some some special colour
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh you like so
C :  So that's alright we will leave it a dash and then i'll take the i can send it back to management say
B :  Yeah
C :  We were quite sure about the colour of like a six true that we've still got some specs for
D :  Yeah
A :  We have yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Excellent
C :  Alright
C :  So i did wheel it is
C :  Um
C :  Oh now evaluation criteria was the real sort of doing that
B :  No
B :  No i don't think so
A :  Not really know
A :  Because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep l. c. d. display
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  The instead of having scrolling we we just push the button
B :  We just got rid of a gimmick that was number and then anyway and the scroll-wheel is i mean essentially the t. buttons that is is not great different same thing
C :  Yeah
A :  Um
C :  Yeah
C :  Alright then
A :  Yeah
A :  But we use the locator
B :  Really
C :  We're gonna have a big
D :  Well it we what we are going to have a beeping thing
A :  So it's sort of speaker of a one
D :  But yeah it's it's not like sample speaker but it will just beep so we still have that okay
C :  Yeah
C :  Yep
B :  Keel
B :  That's a very exciting huh
B :  I think you should make it more vegetables
C :  Yeah
D :  Most colour the the colour of the phone on the colour of the
B :  Oh the the beep i think
C :  Okay
D :  Was it it can be yellow us one it can come in the same colour and stuff
C :  "'cause" we we went to run out of amp option i don't know that
D :  The case
B :  Yeah i think turns into more of a
C :  It's a
D :  Mm
A :  I
B :  To me a pen vibrate
C :  I dunno i i do about it but uh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah i
C :  But i mean for a very short time
C :  Um
C :  Okay
C :  So
C :  Looks like we've
C :  Design they
C :  And uh huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  I
C :  Well that's a uh-huh
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Um all we need we've just got about ten minutes also the left of the meetings so it
C :  It would be good if we could just
C :  Have a little tool that
C :  The project itself and how point
C :  Um
C :  So that we can feed back to the
C :  Management for next on the design a new product
B :  Cool
C :  Feedback ideas
A :  I think uh-huh
D :  Yep um as far as creatures his concern yeah i think that was
D :  That was from for creativity they only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget
C :  Uh-huh
D :  We had
A :  I think the the one thing that was lacking there was that we did not know what to be used things cost to begin with
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah um
A :  Um we cup cup that adding things randomly
C :  Yeah
B :  If we'd have that she in the beginning liaise between like uh okay so we can have that lot
A :  So i've been on uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah that are not yeah
B :  It's just do it together and see what we
D :  Yeah yeah yeah
A :  So the all the time decisions in the end could have been
B :  Yeah
A :  Right okay
C :  But in terms of the process of um
C :  Going on working individually and then coming back to a meeting that
C :  That what does
B :  I think is a meeting so say a regular uh you know it was my real aim for very long so you didn't
C :  In terms of
C :  Mm
B :  Go off and think
B :  When it be going to have a replacing
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
D :  And uh
C :  I don't know i know i i
