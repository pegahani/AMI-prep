C :  Uh
A :  You still working on the design
C :  Mm
C :  Um no i i had not again working on the design
D :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And um
C :  R. i. a. uh it
C :  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control i thought we were designing a new monitor um
C :  The website i went to look at
C :  Had some announcements about an introduction of a um
C :  Uh some sort of a seven inch a a monitor and um i understood that that was the project goal so well um i'm glad i didn't do any work "'kay" um had time because uh
A :  Right
C :  I really didn't understand the project goal
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah um
C :  I just didn't see that are we're starting a project to get the numbers can be for member team composed these people
C :  And to um
C :  That's about the pets and i i read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the states
A :  So it out you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members it's working the t.
A :  For the design
C :  Uh for the industrial design
A :  Yes
C :  Um
C :  Why would they think that depends on how much money he give us
A :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh
A :  That was good
C :  Um because uh you know you can they can make it the
C :  You have different choices for different financial models
A :  Yeah but the before we talk about the the finance okay
A :  Uh do you have some idea a whole week and uh so this product or project in the market
C :  So
A :  And how much is going to the benefit of the company and uh of course it's to the individual also
C :  Well you know well um i kind of think that in general you have to do uh
C :  Um you have to some things very fashionable
C :  That's a very attractive that to um
C :  People see and recognise uh its goal and down they immediately wanna have it to uh
C :  Have one of their um so it would do it would need to um
B :  So
C :  Something like the ipod would be good seems to have caught on really well so um
A :  Mm
C :  I you know i don't care what it does just so it looks cool
A :  Okay
A :  But to uh when you think you can be me like a
A :  Kind of a design on the functional design or the technical design
C :  Well uh i've got a lot other projects and doing right now um and so i'll have to wait and see how those um have those go with they have go quickly then that it could be a month with um i ran into any problems on my other projects it might be six months
A :  Yeah but uh i need something in the right thing so like uh what's your functional design what's the technical design
A :  I know how many people you'll need for this project and what's the timeframe you're looking okay and uh what the budget may be uh initial budget you're looking
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Mm mm
A :  Okay and uh are always going to the market okay so you you'd have to meet with the marketing team and all that went to market and what are the marketing strategy plan
A :  Okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time introduce the product and they you know that that would be a computation okay so i need some kind of uh
A :  Well i don't plan in the lighting from you
A :  Okay and it's called
C :  And what would you like that
A :  As soon as possible
C :  Uh well uh for uh and if we have enough time uh
C :  Then that do you think a um two weeks is uh is close enough
A :  Yes i think it'd be good because i need to go to the management and the tell "'em" what we are going to do and uh what cost us okay and what's the time frame and what's a project plan because uh without any other documentation so i cannot go to the management and say it's up to be a want to do this and we need this much money okay so then it's it's difficult for me to say okay that's reason i need there some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can have the for the discussion again
C :  So
C :  Oh uh are there are the people who will be contributing to the point
A :  Yes of course if you did some help us so let me know so what the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or or the administration point of view okay to adding in a documentation are some technical point of view so just let me know so i can no court met all the teams
C :  Okay get back beyond that
A :  Yes thank you
A :  And uh it there so what's what you think about the
A :  This uh project for the remote controller and it do you have some already plan something for your marketing strategy or at the same strategy
D :  Well not yet or the the know of doing research and taking remote controls looking what other companies have to do uh what are building
D :  They're designs their ideas uh
D :  All set to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into
A :  Uh-huh
D :  That should be a fairly large market because uh the number people that uh the competition
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh i agree has to be something that has to be something
D :  Has to be something that that draws people say a i'd like us
D :  But the worst or not if the first say i like this i like the design
D :  And then it can be simple to use
A :  Yes so what i uh for for a maybe a unique and try the more with the christie okay because
A :  You'll know what she's going to do it
A :  Okay and you know how to seven
A :  Okay because
A :  Uh she's doing the design but you're the court because you're the marketing okay so that you need to sell any you'll the responsible for the all the money the finance
A :  Okay tomorrow
A :  So what i prefer okay so you need to interact with the christian more and then we can have been no okay was good enough functional design or a technical design okay and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan okay well we'll go into the the euros sales that okay
D :  Do we already have a cost
D :  Limit on less than an idea of how much so we want to market this for how much is gonna sell four that's uh that's up to us to decide on it
A :  That's that's
A :  Yes so that's the output decide okay so the best thing is you will well both of the uh the christian and you were discussed it yourself okay and come up with the cost and how we are going to compete in the market okay and all that they can legally or in the same so i spoke to the commercial wise okay then i'll be out the design okay hold on that would take the whole project okay how much is going to cost us and how much we're going to button for the company
A :  Okay of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually
A :  Okay so i think it's a maybe if you can then you need some kind of your the the say it's flat okay including the taken care what they're she's going to talk to you within the team okay then it will help me to discuss that the management for for the okay and put it in the the proper project plan
D :  Are you
A :  And if you need a any coordination in between know come back to the maybe the some they can be combined uh so the commercial man that's okay depends if you want to have some of our marketing plan or taken can plan okay so you let me know
A :  Okay i can coordinate
D :  Right
A :  Art maybe uh
A :  Your mike court make them right
B :  Mm
A :  Between the
A :  Although what
B :  Well no not exactly mean my job from what i understood was
B :  To look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people were gonna use "'em" look at the best ways to do that
B :  So i think i'll have to interact with christine and discuss with her
A :  Let's see
B :  So that she's not designing something that
B :  My studies will show all right off the bat that it's not going to work and so it's sort of it's all that that feeds an but
B :  I don't think necessarily that
B :  I'm in a court meeting position for uh
A :  Yes
A :  Yeah so basically you need to interact with christine more okay for the user tax of ability
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay and the testing okay then use that
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Which was the feed into the marketing because depending on what users want depends on how you sell it what tag lines you attach to that
A :  Yes
A :  Yes
B :  How you try that
A :  Yep
B :  Make it more attractive to users so i think
B :  All three groups so we'll need to interact quite a bit
B :  Um
B :  And then
B :  I guess build a plant based on that because suddenly need to take all the factors into account
A :  What eric was talking to keep add in the loop okay in between you were uh a meeting and christine meeting because like you should know what's happening
B :  Yeah of course
B :  Yeah we can see see him on many discussions or documents that are passed around
A :  Yes okay and please please copy all the main sort all the discussions to me okay so i need to submit to the management
B :  Sure
B :  Um
A :  So any questions for a time being
B :  So the immediate next that is to start determining the functional design or okay
A :  Yes
A :  To come at the functional design and the could discuss that at okay no it's going to work and uh first of all video
A :  Is that acceptance okay how it looks like and how it's going to work on the market
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay so then we can discuss about the for the things
B :  Okay
