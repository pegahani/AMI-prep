C :  How we place in terms of uh
D :  Okay
D :  Okay
D :  Mm
B :  Heck a special product that's that's true
C :  Mm
A :  But that
D :  Okay
B :  I think once for now
C :  As well
C :  As well
D :  I guess
D :  Very hard to drink coffee

A :  Yeah well
A :  It's
B :  Mm mm
A :  Yeah
C :  Mm
A :  Okay like that's kinda getting into it
A :  Right um
A :  So
A :  Just to take up the meeting basically um so we're working yeah for real reaction this is
A :  Also it
A :  Right
A :  Scanning can add to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting
A :  Um
A :  I'm gonna just too quick opening then we can offer a get acquainted with one another um the words are talk a little bit about tool training essentially that means getting used to
A :  The only thing that we haven't tried that yet the whiteboard
A :  Um
A :  We've got a general plan for the project or gonna do about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion and close that
A :  Um
A :  Arrow guess you know
A :  In a sign um in a life um so yeah
A :  Basically
A :  I want to i'm just gonna you get of course we can discuss and thinking about um
A :  A proposing that
A :  Since we've got this a weird blend of
A :  Are cells in our roles that we just don't ask don't tell
A :  Um so um if you say something about marketing right sort of um mm he is
D :  Use gonna believe we will go from there
A :  Exactly um any or if you guys in the same time if you like logically if something that's at the economic we're gonna sell remote control that's the size of this paper but you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x. have is to go with it and we'll discuss it but
D :  For enough
A :  I'm not gonna ask you know that
A :  Area isn't it
D :  Permit yeah
A :  Yeah yeah exactly so because we're we're sort of role playing see agree you you gonna happen to your knowledge as well
D :  Okay
A :  And that's the same for your what we do introductions i mean um a talk about your background to have fun you know maybe you want to um
A :  Uh
A :  You know maybe you like mean you want to use the speech but you wanna see what the harvard or something like that one i you know you can this is seen i guess we can have a lot of the fun with it so big as a curve at assessing want to call
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh yeah that's fine
D :  Luxury
A :  Is
A :  Call so i guess the digits
A :  Worked well we're we're making a remote control which is growing um
A :  Uh about the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate motto i don't know if you guys had time to check the
A :  In a laugh already guess to to check the um
A :  Uh
A :  Corporate website um we've got
A :  To make something is fashionable "'s" possible that's kind of the corporate strategies we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks that and try to make it nice you know like john lewis nicer you know if you get the data and do something
A :  So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in the user friendly
A :  Um slick sleek kind of way
A :  Um we're gonna go about doing that is basically the first we're gonna start on the basics and that's for a really need you guys user interface designers and the um
A :  Um
A :  They
A :  Either designer that i can't remember we
A :  The idea the u. i. d. a. right um
B :  Mm mm
C :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  The industrial designer hey i am i getting into it
D :  Maybe yeah
A :  Um
A :  To guide me in dallas on this project is you're gonna be you you get you guys at the bottom you know you reckon that you can't be that you can have you know x. m. y. um at the same time
A :  And then um
A :  All work out from what is necessary to more like what would be good
A :  You know like um
A :  Uh a few years back at the same email as i did that the idea of um
A :  Yes the coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee
A :  But it's also better if it's not like really cheap class that if you catch your hand or something like that
A :  Um
A :  It's all work out from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about and finally we'll incorporate is kind of the last it in a way you guys build
A :  Are you tell me to tell us what's possible in utah
A :  As what we can
A :  Um hope for and what would it go take the the the take the basics and make it nice and then all of this it uh the u. i. d. the i. d. you know you you can keep on you know call it the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
A :  Um to kind of synch it all up
A :  So that's the detail designed to to three state kind of thing
A :  Um
A :  Right so for now i just for the all the whiteboard um
A :  Basically yeah just a used to it i haven't tried it yet either um i'm just gonna start yeah and i'm carrie like five remotes around

A :  Go in this uh like an orc out i'm sorry you you just can't get a better breed of the what's available on this in san diego
B :  It's different because in san diego of the tricky a circuit on the grown than rubber cover this team that
D :  It must make all the difference
B :  Yeah really that's
D :  I
A :  Well it's it's it there's other things to this you just can't play so like i what i want to school here in santa barbara which is central california
A :  The mexican police okay
A :  It's not good
A :  Like a yeah i think two bucks like literally two bucks for the nasa and that's yeah good call on that
B :  Mm yeah
D :  Right
B :  Yeah uh-huh where you from san diego
A :  Um just literally just met upon us any other like five minutes from the zero
B :  Okay
A :  So north part actually if you wear a specific
B :  Yeah my grandparents lived on um
B :  Thirty second
B :  Close to your workload when coffee shop the sun
A :  Yes and university yeah
B :  Cafe forte
A :  Yeah it's actually like we really have from uh from my house
B :  Cool
A :  They're pretty cool small world
B :  Yeah
A :  As we're discussing before
A :  Special more often the same
A :  General region right so okay success on the whiteboard you can harness you have some power little bit interactions we talked about somewhere c. d.s and things we like about the same uh i think all
D :  These yeah
C :  Mm
C :  Mm
A :  Um right so we want to not fun stuff that project finance
A :  Um basically what we're trying to do so this remote for twenty five euros
A :  Um
A :  This is what defined as a problem is told me the c. f. l. but i don't know i'm not sold on this is pretty here i mean twice that's like you know forty bucks for remote it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're gonna make a lot and the proper names to make fifty million euros on it
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah internationally
A :  So
A :  Um
A :  The wanna things that i was gonna mention to you and you guys the designers is that um i am we probably near of it needs to be a universal remote control probably
B :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  So something that could be u. n. t. s. c. as well as power was was there is uh the format second is gonna control d. v. d.s but um you know a way that's you guys but that's something that is gonna be international so thing
D :  Nice has
A :  Um one try to make it for twelve fifty
A :  So we want rather make a hundred percent profit on if we can
A :  Um straight so i'm just a close that i'm not sure how much time ideas and next time right project manager sort of
A :  Um is i will mean the other half an hour or so um
A :  And and like the um industrial then get
A :  Think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it
A :  Um
A :  U. i. d.
A :  Well yeah you type to use i miss out there in you also get it's assignments from in your emails well morse best specifics um what to do
A :  Um mm base and so you need you tell us what um
A :  We what the users can want
D :  What they're looking for
A :  So actually the way you guys could maybe in our next meeting to have a bit about what the users gonna want you want to use you can have you know like oh so
D :  And you can shake that
A :  Yeah well it is a one will discuss the trade offs in between and say uh specific instructions will be sent in your email
A :  But i think that that is more or less a good place to start from now um and it's more things come up all have meetings and
A :  You can email so so forth um any questions before we get started
C :  I assume that we're building a stand alone a remote control
C :  We can to kind of build it in to other
C :  A products
A :  You mean like
C :  For instance like a a mobile phone
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So that's interesting
A :  Yeah
D :  I have it is we're also that yet so
B :  Maybe or personal coach well
C :  Or or you know i can we pretty can we sell "'em"
B :  That's me to say uh uh
C :  Remote control phone for quite up down to us
A :  Well i have to think about it i mean
C :  Okay
A :  I'm i'm certainly open it seems like yeah this is injected certainly doable isn't it
D :  Yeah
A :  I mean um
A :  Or if we can have a four mobile phone me via remote has some other kind of useful function
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
A :  A clap now i mean
D :  Uh huh
C :  Uh-huh
A :  No they be a good idea was it is you
B :  Maybe
B :  A remote changeable face it's like face they can buy for france
C :  Uh huh a nice
D :  I like so covers thingys
A :  Uh uh you know like that mm
B :  Yeah
C :  Hi
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
A :  That's true i guess we will probably have some time maybe we should bring some are below what we wanna do
A :  Go back to um
A :  Um i haven't let me bring up something about
A :  Our basic goals here what we want to
A :  Accomplish
A :  Uh project announcement
A :  Oh
A :  Mm mm
A :  Yep
A :  Not so much
B :  Uh-huh
A :  I i will find a more um
C :  Now we also discussing her initial ideas alone yeah
A :  Yeah yeah but still it's still
C :  Same way have an initial ideas
A :  I'm going take notes on this to us
D :  "'kay"
D :  Thirty minutes
A :  Yeah any colour yeah uh-huh
D :  Um
A :  So initial ideas
A :  Uh-huh
D :  That's pretty much skin it's gonna be universal
D :  Right we decided that are ready
A :  Yeah
D :  And it may be function for other things this as you said that thing at all the other things you can remotes do you like your microwave or your front door like ten everything on one thing but then
B :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Never a fan of those you'd remotes that have like a million buttons you can tell what they do
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Smaller is better simple
D :  Yeah
C :  I'm thinking
D :  Specific
C :  I'm thinking
C :  Kind of p. d. a.
C :  A design so touchscreen design
C :  Rather than button
D :  Okay
B :  Oh right at the different
C :  So that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things
D :  Interesting
A :  Yeah that's like as in it i mean like
A :  Stylist yeah that is uh yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Sure
A :  As we got five minutes more to chat about this perfect
A :  Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade off between um
A :  Uh size and functionality
D :  Right we want to be marked multifunctional but at the same time a kitty it's too too much you know could we will uh
A :  And then we also
B :  Yeah
C :  Too confusing
D :  Tell the part that at all
B :  It's maybe too complicated it's a crowded buttons and things
D :  Yeah
A :  I was gonna notice
D :  Hmm
A :  For future reference this idea of um
A :  So you recommend like an l. like a touch screen type of remote
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm
C :  Possibly
A :  I don't think what it is a good idea
D :  An interesting option
B :  Needs needs one outstanding features that apart from whatever and that's
D :  Yeah
D :  Definitely
A :  Yeah all the other universal remotes
A :  Um i don't know if it's sitting out there i guess we'll just want to some research on or one of us do some research on about
A :  Whether or not there are um more tie format
A :  Like a um
A :  You know power and tse we can one
D :  Right
C :  I'm pretty sure that is
C :  I mean i i have a friend who has a p. d. a.
A :  Okay
A :  Okay
C :  That you just
C :  Point to the store any television he wants and all figure out the
C :  Uh-huh the specifications of a remote control it
A :  Interesting
D :  Ah so
C :  Um so i i see and that that can be done with uh kind of around the world
A :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Right
A :  Okay
A :  Um alright so
A :  I well i'm like an an idea this idea that touchscreen remote with more than format features um
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Right
A :  Um
A :  Let's see
B :  I think making at it a nice material would be very important because so many those remotes they see this universal remotes looks they're cheap and we'll call you
D :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  Yeah keep it in a sense like would be important
D :  And
D :  I don't know like there's such a problem with losing them
D :  Yeah i think it's hold like t. v. a pen businesses only one with think there's a real be careful what like
D :  Just something like keep in mind we start actually deal with the stuff but
D :  That would be really cool
A :  Uh see
A :  Um
C :  How like the idea of the of multi play-doh
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah yeah okay
D :  Yeah but what what what they call the speech played things
C :  Okay
B :  Yeah
A :  And it's called faceplates i don't know
D :  In a name for the
D :  Okay i don't know
B :  Yeah something like that
C :  I like it
B :  All have to come up and patent it
C :  We should we should come up with a fuzzy one as well
D :  Some really cool
A :  I
D :  I
C :  For those call the winter day so
D :  Leopard print or something
B :  Leopard print
A :  Um
B :  I think it would be such a bad idea to have a cut locator device
B :  Maybe a simple button that you have on a television top you find the remote
D :  Sure
A :  Hmm metaphor by knowing it
A :  In this for selling their telly with the remote
D :  Right
A :  Um
C :  Well three pound always the phone then you can always call it
B :  True
C :  Yeah if you're not doing that then we can have something that just kinda rings from either
D :  Sure
C :  Well there is thilo's whistling devices that will tonight
D :  Right
A :  Cool cool in a decent they were like just a little look like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with a remote that you can play some more l. c. d. press and it makes remote page kinda like our know what i was um uh a cordless regular phones yeah that page button or or
D :  Alright
B :  Yeah
D :  Right
A :  We do something like that
C :  That's cool
B :  I think so
D :  Probably
C :  I think we could design and a uh-huh
B :  Yeah
D :  "'kay" it
A :  Um yeah i think this material qualities well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um
B :  Mm mm
C :  Okay
A :  Uh
A :  You know the apples been really successful with the surgical white kind of business or the sleek kind of you know
D :  Yeah
D :  And that titanium and use over sleek ones that last couple years
A :  Yeah
D :  Very much so
C :  Curves
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah we do have the minimum i'm not i'm not i mean we're talking finance that are not selling out of forty pound remote way our forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty
A :  You know it's pretty expensive so need be we know what it
D :  Right
A :  Trade off some of the features for lower price without without getting in the whole like you know good and the bargain store remote you know bars or universal remote it's black and you know massive some kind of under a balance there and somewhere
D :  Hey
B :  Yeah
D :  Definitely
A :  But um
A :  I think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're gonna sell it and um
D :  Yeah
D :  And if you are users in mind like these
D :  Grammar is are are gonna be in the this whole new uh what's design remotes that used the buttons so after a careful of exactly were marking those two and
B :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  Who we're gonna be able to get out of
B :  It's true
C :  Which are in twenty five pounds a kind of hard currency
A :  Two and five euros
D :  Euros
C :  Slight difference i guess
B :  Mm
A :  Yeah
A :  They're all we couldn't or a sort of a dollar
D :  Mm
A :  Although computer parts
A :  All if you can operate a computer by the states like uh and you have to fries
A :  He computer uh electronics or
A :  Be serve um
A :  I. v. c. r. s.
A :  They will sell things overseas
A :  So you can buy stuff in america should never fight write it down so that
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Right so um
A :  Let's go ahead wrap that up here for now i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got
A :  In the um
A :  Project documents so if you guys what need a reminder about what
A :  We've talked about
A :  Um the different
B :  Okay
A :  You know kind of trade off so we've got another ideas you can sort them a really sure
A :  And uh write something so that that's just they had back to work on what we're talking about for a call it a getting into
D :  The half an hour
A :  Um yes
D :  Okay perfect
A :  Thanks guys
D :  Cool
C :  Thank you
B :  Right
