B :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  The next um
A :  Thing we need to it rests is our financial department to meet are
A :  Our budget um
A :  Or not need our budget but more um
A :  But what kind of uh
A :  Selling range will be looking at
A :  Um
A :  Wanna make this um
A :  As a selling price of twenty-five euros
A :  And so we have to um
A :  Come up with a way to to create a
A :  I uh remote control
A :  Where um
A :  We can
A :  Like the price to create it will be significantly less um we'd like to um
A :  To uh make fifty million euro something that's the end means
A :  Um and make it for an international
A :  Mark it's um one thing we have to think about international used in the design
A :  Of um like different kinds of
A :  A v. c. r.s things like that depending on which country you are
A :  But the thing for the design team to think about
A :  Um we want it to cost um absent maximum of
A :  Twelve
A :  Euro and fifty cents
D :  Okay so we'll have ninety percent profit that
D :  Twelve fifty
A :  And i don't know
D :  Okay
A :  "'kay"
A :  Um
A :  Some now that um
A :  That is underway
A :  Um
B :  Yeah
A :  It is discussion time so that's the time for us to bring our initial ideas
A :  Any um
A :  Suggestions that you may have so far and um
A :  Your personal experiences with remote controls and um
A :  Um there is you see that's uh i could be
A :  Improved your experience with that
A :  Does anyone have any initial thoughts
D :  I find in the dark it's often hard to know about in your pushing
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So something we could uh
A :  Two two
A :  The midi that
B :  Okay
D :  Um
B :  As than that
B :  In a house
B :  The remote control always "'cause" i think it's always so what is the remote control
C :  Yeah
B :  So maybe if you could have some kind of
B :  Tracking device of the remote control of some
A :  I
B :  Signal that you could find out where one for the uh to do some kind of allow you can press a button on your wall
A :  Yeah it's a great idea it's a good idea
B :  You know
B :  "'cause" it always gets lost
C :  T. is not find that um
C :  Like there's a lot of
C :  Um
C :  And so on your remote control and you don't know why i wasn't it
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah they don't use half of
A :  Uh-huh
C :  I don't know what to do it
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  Some remote controls are those kind of a hidden panel it's all those plan and so you don't really use also programming or something that's useful
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah that's
B :  That's
B :  Yeah it is
D :  So you just have like the number buttons power but in
D :  T. v. video but in
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Right anything about um
A :  The look of the
A :  Uh remote control they
A :  You might have ideas about maybe it could be
A :  So like a standard rectangular
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Shape it could be um
A :  Something more interesting like
A :  Any ideas we'll do you have this point
B :  Mm mm
D :  Could be shaped like a college
A :  I
B :  Okay
C :  Yeah
D :  Hmmm like a shell shaped or
A :  I
A :  Can hold it
B :  And uh we'll see
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Are we going into it kind of novelty fact to see like i've seen them
A :  Well if it's a trendy original um aspect were going for you to design it you think you can um decide what kind of
B :  So it's like a
B :  Okay
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
A :  Um direction you wanna go in but at this point in the in the first meeting you can
B :  Yeah
A :  Be any ideas that we just throw out there
B :  I says if we had having
B :  To have it like
B :  Make each profit out of this it needs to be quite a university except the thing like a novelty thing miami so if you
C :  Yeah
B :  Things rather than like in general kind of
B :  More acceptable but
A :  Uh-huh
B :  We don't wanna go to look boring "'cause" that one side of the
A :  And key issue here is is being trendy an original
A :  And that that's not necessarily mean
A :  It needs to be all read yes
A :  We have five minutes left
A :  So just cover
A :  We have one more thing
A :  Um but you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times um

D :  Interface
B :  Industrial designer that's me uh huh yeah
A :  Industrial designer have to remember these things um
A :  You'll be beginning you were you're working design
A :  Um u. i. d. the technical functions design will will be worked on the next thirty minutes um
