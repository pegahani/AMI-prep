A :  Um
A :  So
A :  So i aim is to produce remote control that is original trendy and user-friendly
A :  And do this we have to
A :  Um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of thing
A :  So
A :  Oh
A :  After this right
A :  Functional design conceptual design and detailed design so
A :  Throughout our next couple of meetings will will be covering these things
A :  Hmm
A :  So we're gonna try underway porridge
A :  If
A :  Paul trawler favourite animal
A :  To solve the characteristics of that animal

C :  When we do play with
A :  Both
D :  It starts
D :  We have to decide to stop so
D :  No
A :  Any volunteers
A :  So you're know they wanna draw i
C :  Mm but i think about a second
C :  Uh
C :  "'cause" i have to be
C :  Functional trendy and user-friendly
B :  I
A :  I i don't think so
C :  Um
C :  Okay also also
C :  Sure what i see
C :  Okay my favourite animal i was
C :  Mm
C :  Oops

C :  Yeah it's i
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  We claim pictionary
C :  Uh yeah i guess it has of thing and to
C :  Slide off
A :  It's what characteristics feel like you're right you're at all
C :  I like its tail
C :  Um that i think buttons are really
C :  Um
C :  Another smart and they they are two
C :  And
C :  They like swimming in that school like
A :  The graceful
C :  The graceful yeah and there so
A :  Sleek
C :  Yeah they're sleek in a look intelligent and
C :  I don't know there
C :  "'cause" it's a little it by now killer
A :  And and know how intelligent that one i
C :  Isn't think
C :  Yeah here here's a thoughts
A :  I
C :  He's uh
C :  I dunno in
C :  To
C :  I think it's cool the
C :  The um
C :  The interaction that are that are things that the reasons
C :  People seem to like you know
C :  You get exterior people are saying on the beach and all that there's dolphins it's kinda like
C :  But there you know the jump around the water in their happy and
C :  Variables that they
C :  It's one
A :  So nobody else um uh
A :  Shall the animal
B :  I suppose i can draw an animal
A :  Uh uh maybe as the time
A :  The cat i
B :  Yeah
B :  I don't know they sleep all the
B :  Is it a job
A :  Yeah
D :  Right yeah
A :  And then thing i don't know if that
D :  Well i had a cat as well but
B :  I think the pen is running out of
A :  Uhuh
C :  I
D :  Uh i've noticed that one
D :  Uh is is that one
D :  Um but it's hard to draw all
C :  And the pens i think
D :  Um
A :  How it's
C :  Oh yes
D :  Oh right i i
A :  That's a good
D :  Uh the like the good anywhere
D :  Would it not
D :  Um
D :  At the main reason is that pretty i think they have a pretty and they go well with the environment on by the way they were on the noise to do was wondering that just very to to study a nice animals
D :  And i like the way um
D :  They feel sort of on the
D :  On the ground and that's pretty much it
D :  Um
A :  Okay yeah
A :  They score it's
A :  Yeah
A :  Actually on but i think yeah i
A :  Um
A :  It's a pig yeah yeah
A :  So i think we should design a remote control that's
A :  Water resistant
A :  Strong and very
A :  You think
C :  And furry
A :  Yeah well we could have in
C :  Text file text a whole
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Stuff yeah yeah yeah
C :  Tack um
A :  But but um it's uh-huh
A :  Right
C :  Keep dragging uh if you have a tail
A :  As you are my cache think this is disastrous
C :  I
C :  Mm
A :  Sorry about that
A :  Mm
A :  So moving on
A :  I i selling price goal is twenty five euro
A :  And
A :  Profit aim is fifty million euro
A :  So
A :  I'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland for in some european kind is he
A :  Um
A :  And you hope to sell this internationally
C :  Sorry can you say that with the
C :  What our price calls again
A :  Um selling price of twenty-five euro
A :  Profit aim
A :  Fifty million
A :  Yeah
D :  How many should we sell them
D :  Oh no
A :  Anyone a mass petition
D :  Two
D :  Right timit know
D :  Form
B :  Two million
D :  Four million
D :  And that well it's a profits uh
D :  The profit for each is twelve fifty
B :  Oh yeah
D :  Oh the form and
D :  Well
D :  Oh
A :  So that's uh fifty percent um or
A :  Um
A :  I don't know these mean because i didn't actually slide show
A :  Experience with remote control
A :  So
A :  I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what
A :  Um
A :  We would like to see it in a convenient practical
A :  Nice remote control
A :  Um so do we have any initial ideas for how this remote
A :  Control should be designed
A :  Or format to do that
A :  The buttons it should have
D :  I think one thing is that it should be easy to find
C :  I was thinking that too i think we should design something that has like uh
B :  I
D :  Yeah quick
A :  Yeah
C :  So you can
C :  Like somehow like you i mean you always know you t. v. is so shall call but not always want that's all i can push a button on your t. v. yeah yeah yeah yeah see should have a call button on your television to be able to find the remote control
B :  Okay
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
A :  I mean you have uh for the portable so and so why not yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  And even i think a little light
D :  Um or even uh uh maybe
D :  Uh but uh vibrating thing i dunno but something because it's usually under that so far
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  In which case again to be that but it it has a sort of signal which isn't a nice and and and and it's expensive maybe
C :  Yeah
C :  I don't yeah i mean it
D :  Maybe call is enough but yeah
C :  But like you mean
C :  Just having like your phone even just has some like it can vibrated can light up and make noise and i dunno
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  What i had something like um
A :  Just like a magnet on the back of it
A :  And you could
A :  I mean she just have some place to put it
A :  The sides like a base you know like a portable phone has a days
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah if i had uh
C :  Yeah
A :  Like just have a home for it i
D :  Yeah yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah i mean
A :  "'cause" you got a cigar top the t. v. but
A :  The point of having a remote is not have to walk over so that you you sir
C :  Yeah
B :  What's what's always in the cabbage
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah in in the couch or
C :  I don't know it seems like that that that would be hard because
C :  You know you're gonna be lazy anyway and
A :  Maybe we should design catch is to have a remote control in
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah so we have a project is now catches
A :  This i know i i
D :  Even just think that that's it to go in and you had a thing that pretty object attached to the wall but that would really make it more expensive but it's only a plastic
C :  Yeah
D :  Thing
C :  Yeah
D :  Single
D :  Something like that
D :  And the thing it
A :  Do you think it needs to be bigger to not only is there
A :  Is that a factor
C :  Bigger
D :  Not well it needs to be sort of
A :  Like
A :  And
C :  Hand sized
A :  And helped us a
D :  Yeah
D :  And then we need to
A :  Not not huge but
B :  Mm hm
D :  But definitely not
D :  Uh huh
C :  It can't be that hard to put some time in no way is
C :  Right
D :  And uh huh
B :  No really wouldn't be
C :  Or like
C :  Or like a light
C :  The thing you know
C :  Or uh huh
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Spaceship
C :  Yeah
C :  Or make it more power source close
C :  You can find you
C :  That would be really
C :  Sure you do that for twenty five years apart
A :  Well homing device is
C :  I
C :  Uh
A :  Um
A :  Okay
A :  So what do we think this remote controls uh
A :  Five minutes
D :  And uh
A :  And be right
A :  So we have lost
C :  I also think that it
A :  A list of
C :  It shouldn't have too many buttons "'cause" i hate that one i have too many buttons and
B :  Yeah i agree
B :  Uh-huh be a button and you have a button they don't do anything
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah uh
C :  I mean i know it has to have an of functions but like
C :  Uh
C :  Just have like a thousand buttons and you're like no you never use have them
A :  I would have um
A :  Maybe more fancy but what if it had like a little screen so
A :  It has was buttons but still has all the functions
C :  That would be cool
A :  Like the way mobile phone that's
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  I mean it just seems like
A :  So you could like um
C :  Yeah
A :  Like if you have a lot of you have subtle if you've a hundred channels you can the way your your radio it that you would you call it
D :  Select
A :  Is it yeah but you can program
A :  So you can program like your favourite channels
A :  So like if you had uh
D :  But would you have the screen on the thing or the other on the telly transmitting the screen
A :  That's something we could decide
C :  I guess they would go together so now i don't know
D :  Okay is
D :  Because i don't know that's
D :  He he the expanded if you have to use that i. d. screen because it and it's already a screen
D :  Then you can
D :  Probe sort of have a programming function really easy sort of arrow up and down on the remote and then use that ideas the screen
A :  Yeah
A :  Right
D :  But um
C :  Thinking kind of
D :  The official something like not it's not on the bottom but it's telling you what to do is that we go
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Mm
C :  Is like yeast you see as you know people um page of like slavery crepes kind of things when like
C :  They have all those these things at their house you know that it has to so i tried and they have like this one master control that
C :  And it's like a hand held it
C :  Turned on everything sort of control and that's like a screen and make
C :  So i think it should be possible to have some kind of screen no
C :  Most it would well it was takes too expensive that's like don't know
D :  But like mobile phones have screens in a cheap
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah that's yeah
A :  And we have to remember budget just twelve
A :  But twelve fifty four
A :  To actually make the device
C :  Mm
C :  Well i guess if you get to that later yeah
A :  But that's um then the thing about yeah
A :  Or we have to see how much a bit
D :  Also it do we can find out probably on
D :  In
D :  Oh that's it
D :  Um
D :  Yeah the other thing you said that thing about robust and
D :  Walter um
D :  What was about to well to resistor
C :  Very
A :  Oh i was s. i.
C :  Yeah
D :  That but it is i thought i i a spot on
A :  I
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Could feel packed packed i'll
A :  Yeah
D :  That act of feel maybe something than doesn't make your hand swept locked
C :  Yeah
D :  That's quite a morning
A :  Maybe a um just like it's terrible thing that i
A :  Oh i see it's a bit idiap i think that's another
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah yep
D :  The
A :  Yeah
A :  We should probably start wrapping up and we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into
A :  Um
A :  And come up with some new ones for the next meeting which will be in the thirty minutes
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  Yeah
A :  D.
A :  And that's real design and what is the centre idea um it's going to be looking more into the working design so i guess you'd be looking the bottom of things to discuss that screen and
B :  Yeah i think so
A :  Um
A :  That's sort of
A :  Thing
A :  Thingy
A :  Some of them is that u. i.
B :  User
C :  That's me
A :  It was that's ever gone
C :  At user interface design
A :  User interface uh
A :  So that's gonna be
A :  Right technical i guess the baby the working design has also to do with like the physical it like just
C :  So
A :  The way it works and where we
C :  Technical function
B :  The working design is the structure
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  What is technical functions but uh uh well you know one
A :  Um
C :  A nice
A :  I guess you'd have to find out
D :  It says on the email but uh
B :  Um
B :  It was in the email
C :  It does but i i just don't really
B :  I wrote down what mine where
D :  It said um
C :  Yeah
D :  It's that it's
C :  Oh what effect should the thing uh sure okay
C :  Right
D :  Yeah like
C :  And working design okay
D :  B. m. e. d. in between you and that alley
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Right so
C :  Right
C :  Now works okay right on task
A :  And the
A :  And me a bonus of a minute
B :  Marketing
A :  Mark of a
D :  Uh the streets and yeah
A :  Um
D :  Um
A :  So i'll be working on the user requirements
A :  Um
A :  Yeah
D :  Okay
A :  So i guess that wraps it up
A :  I'll see you all and thirty minutes
