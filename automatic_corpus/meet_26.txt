A :  So
D :  So
A :  You ready
A :  Forties a functional design and
D :  Of course
A :  Um
A :  That's all i will do
A :  I mean it's
A :  Mm u. v. you are going to presentation
A :  And uh we want to know all
A :  Two at the end to know the new project requirements
A :  So
A :  We need the uh to know what the the user uh it needs
A :  That's wonderful feel for soon
A :  Uh from the technical part we want to know how
A :  You going to work
A :  And um
A :  So apart
A :  Uh
A :  Remember
A :  It's not very good
A :  Out of course how to
A :  The design this uh this
D :  Nite stuff
A :  So
A :  Um
A :  Let's go for that should presentations first time
D :  Who starts
A :  Marketing
A :  Expert
D :  Okay
A :  I mean
D :  So even if they can do that thing is yeah
D :  So is being we decide do you want
D :  Yeah open it up
D :  I hope i saved it
D :  So for them
B :  So in danger
B :  I noticed mean uh
D :  This is my name
A :  Sounds mm
B :  Hmmm with a four
D :  So as you know you i think you already know mean it's a menu and the expert in marketing in a want to tell you about what people are the wall and uh like in disliking
D :  Remote controls
D :  And then i hope this is going to help you can
D :  To design it creaky so
D :  Next please
D :  Uh
C :  Yeah just put it uh
A :  Hmm
C :  The for the spring
D :  Yeah maybe in the front page because it
B :  F. five
D :  I spent a lot of time doing this presentation so
A :  F. five
D :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
D :  So
D :  Basically uh what i suggest is that uh instead of deciding also for
D :  What could be and what should be
D :  Good the remote control that's ask people who are users of remote controls
D :  How they feel about to the crack remote controls would be like but you don't like
D :  And uh
D :  And what to do with them by the way because they're supposed to be useful
D :  Don't forget about that
D :  So we've we've got the to the
D :  A survey on on the use of the
D :  Remote controls
D :  And i'd like to show you some of the results we found one be survey
D :  Uh next please
D :  Yeah so
D :  Basically
D :  What we found was that uh yeah so all things that the user bolts i can remote controls
D :  First of all they find it very ugly
D :  Current remote controls uh you know they are
D :  The same as this one the day or not
D :  Nice colour not nice say that
D :  All the same uh that not
D :  It good-looking
D :  Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for it nice
D :  And you can fancy looking
D :  The remote control so uh i think we should pretty spend lots of time and effort and that's
D :  Um
D :  And the other thing is that
D :  Do you do current remote controls are not so easy to use and it did
D :  The the current the
D :  First lady's that the uh for do not match what
D :  People really want to use their remote controls
D :  First that's uh we see that the the zap very often so uh i think this is a very
D :  Is important the functionality that it should be easy for them to
D :  Was that uh in one way or another
D :  And most of the buttons uh on the current remote controls are not used
D :  So i think we should decide something where some of the buttons which are those that are used
D :  Should be easier to see in use then
D :  Others that are only a couple of people are using
D :  Um
D :  Next please
D :  Now
D :  People are very frustrated with here
D :  Remote controls um
D :  For instance uh
D :  They don't even find it
D :  Is that from that somewhere in the the
D :  In your home and nobody knows where it is maybe if we have something where we could
D :  Ask the remote control please where are you
D :  Like a yeah
D :  Something to to like that i think phones some of the phones have some of these kind of so functionality
D :  Yeah of course phone you can always phone your phone
C :  Hmm
D :  You can phone your remote control
C :  You can
C :  Here they're doing
A :  Why not
D :  But why not yeah
D :  And because of the fact that there's so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use in fact they don't even know how to use them so most of the the people say they they don't know how to do to use properly their remote controls
D :  And uh they are bad for r. s. i. but uh i don't remember what you sarah sorry
D :  So i think they are bad
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay yeah
A :  Yeah that's great
B :  There are signs
B :  Mm hmm
D :  Mm hmm
D :  Mm nobody has any idea about that
D :  Wow
D :  I'll check in with my
C :  Yeah it's electromagnet be where is that was something kind of them
D :  Oh
B :  No
D :  Okay i think it's a technical thing which
C :  Yeah because infra-red to use this um
D :  Okay
C :  And from and we wanted and does this have hi
A :  Okay
D :  So we've seen it
B :  Six per cent yeah
D :  People for
D :  I can't say that we don't know i
D :  But we have to take this and that out
B :  Every fourth you know
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah it's
D :  I think
B :  Uh huh so
C :  The balloon
B :  Some of us knows
D :  So anyway that's for what the biggest frustrations of the user and um
D :  Where does all i have
D :  Next time
D :  Oh yeah
B :  Uh-huh
D :  So we just had a couple of uh
B :  And it's
D :  It's functions that made be uh use but you do use or in the current
D :  Yeah
D :  Available uh
D :  Remote control so and uh well
D :  The table is not very nice to read but
D :  What is important is to understand that the power button
D :  He's not used often because in general you
D :  Used only once per session that it is very relevant
D :  People that want to have a power button
D :  Channel selection is uh but often used very often use
D :  And indeed
D :  Yeah very relevant
D :  Uh
D :  Well i remember what is the r. s. i.
A :  That uh huh
D :  It's for kids the t. v. t. stress injury
D :  We have to be careful with that word but
D :  Oh yeah
D :  Anyway i continue a presentation so yeah channel selection is um
D :  They're important very often used
D :  I am
D :  Is not often used the people uh um
D :  Want to have controls do you mean that makes sense of course
D :  And that then you have things which are very much less often use like the settings audio settings screen settings
D :  Even teletext and channel settings all of them
D :  Not that often used and the arts more or less relevant it seems that people find teletext teletext they're relevant even if i personally never use it but it seems that
D :  It's either sort of at at least
D :  So
A :  I've been told that
A :  We
A :  Uh i don't consider teletext that it out of date
A :  Because of internet
D :  I can't tell you that a in an in this case between one and then uh
D :  Relevant to not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this which is not as uh these these two one well how that thing then i think
D :  But but if you compare with these ones
D :  It i think this corner one or two rubber that's all
D :  If if that would reason not to put t. v. text it's okay but just
D :  No would that people find it somehow rid of it
B :  Uh-huh
D :  That's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask a a a stuff so what
D :  People don't have that may be useful for instance i think next next slide
D :  One of the thing and the trend the that uh you are pretty aware of is the possibility d. is that a possibility of having
D :  Speech recognition in a remote control so you wouldn't have to that
D :  That in your buttons but just take your remote control or
D :  Whatever you need you have
D :  What you want
D :  So we've got it in the survey about the weather people would like are not to have
D :  Uh this kind of uh of function meeting their remote control and as we can see
D :  It really does a d. h.
D :  Young people
D :  Pretty because it's a buzzword find it very relevant
D :  And uh as the age goes up up
D :  Yeah
D :  Dear evans goes down
D :  So now it really depends on the kind of uh
D :  Targeting the uh what who are we targeting with these remote control i think he for a targeting young people than that it's pretty something we have to consider if we are targeting young a very old people this is something theory don't know why they should be so
D :  Now this is of course
D :  And on that
D :  And um i don't have any conclusion a didn't have time the meeting was very hyped
D :  So that's basically my findings uh if you have any question
A :  Mm i think it's good okay i don't know
A :  Good preview
D :  I think about
B :  That one question
C :  I think it
D :  Yeah one question yeah
B :  Uh uh your market experts so
D :  Yeah
B :  Should we aim at a young people or not
D :  I think we should aim at the end people
D :  But uh i think they are
D :  They are
D :  Those uh
D :  Who might be more interested in in the new device and they all the the
D :  Early adopters of the new device our young people less than
B :  Okay
D :  More than
B :  Then teletext is use less
D :  But it it this is uses for them i think yeah
D :  Because we do have had a means of finding their information
A :  That's a good point
D :  Okay
C :  Thank you
A :  So um
A :  No i've seen kids to turn on the
A :  Yeah
A :  I should
A :  Mm
A :  All of that
A :  Technical function
A :  So all
D :  So i think it's you
A :  Uh
C :  Uh it's
B :  That's me
C :  Mm function
A :  What if it
D :  No user requirement know
A :  So
C :  At the working design
A :  So you're
B :  Yes that is but number three
B :  Yes
B :  Mm hmm
B :  So my name is marked wide and um
B :  I'm responsible for user interface design
B :  Our um
B :  And project manager
B :  Ask me to do some presentation about technical functions design
B :  Ah yes i am a more an artist
B :  That's gonna be
B :  Last technical functions but more user interface and kinda intentions and
B :  I was an adjustment was it's so next slide please
B :  And the the general my third which is seems to be more useful for all task is not to forget about the welcome razor
B :  We should narrow complicate things too much we should only make a remote control
B :  Nasa more
B :  Uh some of those it's just a remote control
B :  "'cause" current remote controls so they're never easy enough
B :  To use
B :  So make it "'cause" it's
B :  So here is is a remote control
B :  It's quite taste
B :  Janet one but it's not from a t. v.
B :  It's from a much
B :  He's a a a device like air conditioning or something
B :  But you know
B :  We can use it
B :  For a t. v. easily
B :  All the buttons we need is on off
B :  Volume channels
B :  And maybe some options are
B :  Sounds else
B :  And
B :  Does make a quick
B :  Compared disease one
D :  I
B :  Which one would you prefer
B :  I guess this
D :  I would say the simplest one as long as they are the i find the buttons are they need to give it a menu button
B :  Sure
B :  Sure
C :  Maybe it can be yeah maybe love it
C :  Between those two
B :  And uh what methods is going to be pro white simple
A :  Oops sorry
B :  Simple design isn't a simple actions
D :  So that's
B :  Findings
A :  Oh sorry
B :  A passion uh style
B :  We should
B :  Remember
B :  Is that our company
B :  Puts fashion into electronics
B :  Can we should never forget about it
B :  Concept
C :  This
C :  Is it
B :  The simple
B :  The simple and you only nouns this market
B :  Mark it doesn't of remote control so you know it better
B :  It's very
B :  Well it's
B :  It's not an easy field trip to play you know
B :  So the simple
B :  For personal preferences i have seen is that
B :  To make a baby proof remote control i get to be titanium
B :  It's a really good style
B :  You tend to be a look like
B :  Like these
B :  It is unbreakable and it is
B :  More universal
B :  We'll have a screen with the backlights we can change colours
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And we can put all the options into the screen
B :  We'll need only a few buttons all the other
B :  Things can be control
B :  True's a screen
B :  And all those buttons should be easy to find them too quick because when you watch a movie
B :  And you want to change something
B :  You always try to find a good button and click it but you should do it by a
B :  That's in it and fine and these are just like that which
B :  So
B :  That's
B :  I would propose this concept for the design
B :  Just few buttons the screen was the backlight which can change
B :  Colours titanium
B :  I think and the
B :  What else
B :  I but just for it
B :  View and good idea it's
B :  We need power and volume
B :  And let us include to nice features inches isn't device first power on and off can be made for the automatic
B :  When you go to the so for take a control and pointed to the t. v.
A :  It's all it's um
B :  Is it t. v. turns on
D :  And one as it turned off
B :  When you don't as the control but you go out of it
D :  Oh yeah
B :  For for enough time like to you
D :  Sensing sensor machine that yeah
B :  It's a question to our technique all
C :  One
A :  Yeah
B :  These are are
B :  Changing it
B :  And then as a nice feature that i would like to implement is a wall in control suppose you said that you set up some volume
B :  And then you move out or you move to the other car
B :  All the room and take a control with you
B :  Like you want them to change that chair or you want to move does it down to have some uh so far
A :  We want that's the kitchen
B :  Something
B :  And then they won't changes
A :  Mm
B :  It is it to do it just control the
D :  According to your does does
C :  These things
B :  According to the distance
D :  And the angle maybe if you have a six euros fifty
B :  Oh yeah yeah yeah
D :  I'm not sure about the screen what what easy to use the usefulness of the screen at ease of the touchscreen they do it
B :  I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with the left right up down and enter
D :  So you these instructions but uh it has to be then backlight somehow
B :  So it's mean per person fact is that
B :  Back liked
D :  Okay
B :  Which change colours which makes it easier to find
B :  And they each can you can respond for your voice like it can turn on the lights
B :  For you just
B :  To find it as a light no
D :  Okay
B :  So basically that's it
A :  And i see that should do i get us a verification not on the t. v. but
A :  You that we talk about the universe so uh uh a remote control
B :  Can be easily down "'cause"
A :  Yes
B :  You got simple designs
B :  We should put it just simple actions
B :  But to be universal
B :  So you want to use it for your hi-fi system
B :  You want to change tracks
D :  Mm
B :  And you want to just wondering
B :  Just a few actions
B :  Few options for ever seen
B :  Also have to we should we will put it into is this menu on the screen
A :  Since we're targeting a really use some know a date for the
A :  Be an e. e. stream of this uh remote control i think we will only call straight on t. v. for the moment um
B :  Okay okay
C :  Yeah indeed
A :  Then then maybe to make it more generalise yeah
B :  Okay but it's quite universal yeah
B :  We can just extend that trendy device
D :  So far as i said i want to go to lead directly to channel twenty five how would it be kind i do that with this
B :  At twenty five
D :  Yeah that's a i'm on channel eight now you know these these we have hundreds of channels that's not so easy to go just next next next we have hundreds of channels
B :  In fact i would propose another solution
D :  Or is it
B :  Basically use just for five channels
B :  Right
D :  Most people yeah
B :  So
B :  Uh set-up get t. v.
B :  Set like
B :  Channels that to use their one two three and five
B :  And you will never have to go to the twenty first
D :  And i think in one their remote control i've seen instead of doing that that you could just say these are
D :  Did chance to channel three
D :  Twenty eight forty eight and the sixty four of those that i want to be cycle with my next button
A :  Case is the same solution
D :  Yeah
C :  But the end you can have some
C :  Uh is it a display that you can
C :  Uh do you can use
D :  Go to channel five
C :  But then the number and then it
D :  One thing is that as i said in my presentation people read do we like to see zap so even if there are only watching for five channels i think they want to zap a lot of the one hundred channels
B :  Uh huh
C :  Yeah
D :  Just because this is one kind of thing to do zapping
A :  Yeah and zap it's only next next next next
D :  And it's on a next yeah so but you have to
B :  We've got is buttons yeah
D :  Okay
B :  Next next
B :  One was saying is this can be back
C :  But are there is like you can put some display on numbers and then they can just press
D :  So it would be
C :  So was to fly d. displays four five and uh
C :  Yeah
A :  Maybe we can make it different modes for each button
A :  You can change mode that not or
D :  Uh-huh are
A :  Uh to rent uh so
C :  It was since we're focusing on and t. v. remote controls all
A :  Yeah
C :  We can have more functions for t. v.
C :  If you want to go for you know so that we have to limit for
C :  Function for each of four devices
D :  Okay
B :  Could look carry out some research if you're really need this
B :  Like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and ten to sixty four
D :  Oh i could
D :  Could have a look at that i think maybe
D :  That all checking my department is there someone space anything
B :  Okay
D :  Well for why don't know
B :  Thanks for attention
A :  In each
A :  So now all it and the technique that aspects of
A :  Yes
A :  The new device
A :  Mm
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Sorry
A :  You prefer
C :  Yeah
C :  I assume and miss for a while
C :  I mean explored in an industrial design of war
C :  A kind of devices
C :  And i previously devised
C :  Many uh like this take a look at it from from that when it came with this
C :  It's annoying briefly
C :  The scrap
C :  The working design a four
C :  Remote control
C :  The casing the the basic function
C :  Off remote control is
C :  Sending some nice it's pretty
C :  The device like t. v. or
C :  V. c. r. or d. v. d. player et cetera
C :  So we have
C :  Portable device
C :  Which will send messages to the
C :  The main device that t. v.
C :  So we need to have some energy source
C :  To know what to do the functions
C :  What we want
C :  On these portable device
C :  And usually
C :  These
C :  So to do these functions we need an improvised it's basically some kind of
C :  Pressing buttons or keys
C :  Or like when when jack or something like that
C :  And then these
C :  Miss it is
C :  These key buttons can be transformed into
C :  Some kind of miss a day and then
C :  You did a process by the cheap
C :  And then it will generate some
C :  Information to the main device
C :  It's generally in the form of infrared or
C :  Some kind of just
C :  Sense of information
C :  Then we'll have
C :  The main controller in the main device
C :  To do the particular action
C :  What do you want
C :  So basically we need
C :  Alright since we're focusing on all work and a place to a spectral remote control
C :  We need feel components maybe the energy source
C :  Like the back to be and then we have
C :  User interface
C :  Like
C :  Uh the keypad and no buttons we want
C :  And then we have some
C :  Chip it's mainly
C :  Just assume imposing to be was since we are
C :  Hi in one doing mostly d.s to
C :  I'd device this we had to have some kind of
C :  "'cause" those are
C :  Which take care of all these functions and put it in somebody's data format
C :  And then we'll have in the
C :  Infrared l. e. d. source which sends the information to the main device
C :  Then we'll has siege you know our main head and device to do particular operations
C :  And we had to do
C :  Different course for different t. v.s
C :  So some t. v.s will have
C :  Different
C :  Encryption court for
C :  Links to search on a chain you know and these things
A :  To make it quite uh and you're neither so the device
C :  Yeah because
C :  People don't use one particular band sort
C :  Yeah but at least we have
C :  More more than five branch which are really cool
C :  So we need to
C :  Today specifications and
C :  Do they or encryption that's
C :  Pricing information but it t. v. device
C :  So we need to have particular encryption courts
C :  Then components
C :  So we have the main
C :  Alright energy source
C :  And then we'll have some buttons
C :  And then we'll have infrared
C :  Uh source
C :  And then we have some inset
C :  Some chip in
C :  And the device
C :  Classes i don't have much time so i mean
C :  Put down
C :  Kind of trends
C :  Store this components and
C :  Since i also want to oh
C :  No feedback from
C :  Or marketing explored and user interface
C :  So if you want to add some more components we can
A :  And from uh from the discussion we had you can you make it on the whiteboard or
C :  Go bread
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  I'm sure because since
C :  Or
C :  User interface
C :  In to sustain speech recognition and also marketing export phone that
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Speech recognition used really handy
C :  So we can have and uh
C :  Like cuss simple speech recogniser on or d.s be cheap
C :  Since we have
C :  Some kind of uh energy disease
C :  Or
C :  This normal battery so this battery
C :  One ceases to see jonah it to tape all around
C :  You can have some speech recognition and you know or generally
C :  Smaller reduce the signal crossing cheap
C :  So that and do it
C :  Or
C :  And that's more uh simple speech recogniser and you can also are trying the speech recogniser
C :  For a particular user
C :  So you just
A :  Training okay
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
C :  So these issues simple
B :  Too complex
C :  Okay
D :  The very very good to sell
C :  Yeah
C :  Leaving you you can find him and the simple um oh by the device like any more bulb and you can have this voice dallas or these things
D :  Think of all these young people who would love to say that this remote control on you work for them
B :  Okay
B :  Okay
D :  And how you cannot use my remote control because it's targeted to me
A :  Yeah
D :  Whatever
A :  And what about the price of these components
C :  Are maybe v. can make well meeting five euros and
A :  He said
A :  Okay
C :  You know less than that because we want to have
D :  Millions
C :  Uh me and send in bulk so
A :  Uh-huh
C :  We can make really
C :  And you want to make really simple device because
C :  We have only
C :  But if you watch like
C :  Like paul or switch on
C :  Are some like then you'd have
C :  Something like to use so um
C :  Yeah well you know
C :  And then we'll have to
C :  But let's i'm not
C :  So users can
D :  The user uh we just be able to say uh he's can you but but but but but but the real more or eat we be something like volume
C :  They said
C :  No it yellow
C :  The user can use any kind of send them but it they should
C :  Have this prompter boards volume and then
A :  Ways that keywords uh-huh
C :  Yeah well you might be keys are increase or the date only recognised or sports and
D :  But uh for it
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And does
C :  It and it is a user to say i see more and then it become more my kind of them
D :  Okay
C :  And then we can have johno they can say okay i want to eight
C :  Those we'll not like the users have
C :  Different programs them and they don't really follow saint thomas pictures or
C :  You just want some a number of we don't want like b. b. c. or c. n. n. or
D :  Of course uh it has to be uh
C :  Something else for this
C :  It will be complicated
B :  Okay
C :  So you have only
C :  These d. a. main base a
D :  Okay
C :  And in a volume is not really speech recognition products
C :  In it will be take care of our main
B :  No it's conceptual question is now i see
B :  Is this picture in front of my is like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it will do well that's all them uh
A :  I
D :  But i think he is
B :  And he's going you know these are the night "'cause" it's
B :  Don up down
A :  I
D :  First of all i i think this is not so the function easy it is being could be instead off using the buttons it's on top of using about that
A :  Not in not not only speech
B :  Okay for as as budget like twelve euros
A :  It's an option
D :  Well i don't know
C :  No actually v. can have one switched or like the switch on one of these days to process and
C :  These really better days so was like here we have our main chip which controls
C :  Or volume and these buttons and this t. s. b.'s
C :  Again these to have some interaction like so was people use these big and
C :  Reportedly sends some information to be
C :  She played
C :  In some form like more lemon trees or like this key that
C :  See you not be
C :  Like very expensive know since you're only focusing on
D :  T. v.
C :  T. v. remote control so
A :  Okay
B :  Uh-huh
