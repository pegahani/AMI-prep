A :  It's in here
A :  Okay
A :  Hello everyone
D :  Hi
B :  Okay
A :  Um well uh how we doing
C :  Yeah good
A :  Uh first we going uh oh we're the um
A :  Minutes of the last
A :  Meeting more or less
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um in the last meeting uh the marketing
A :  Match or had presentate are
A :  Her
A :  Method of working meeting there any suggestions
A :  From everyone to have to see how she best could market to do this
A :  This product at the within the budget and that was given
A :  Uh i
A :  In general
A :  The idea is that it should be something that it's not difficult to use
A :  Um
A :  It's also an item that people who was a lot to
A :  So we should address that
A :  And of course it should be
A :  Something
A :  That is very simple to use
A :  In addition to that to make it
A :  Sell of course uh the marketing manager who wishes that it's be very attractive for like she says put some sizzling to it in one way or another
A :  So that that people are buying it now
A :  Because in particular we smaller items that's a very important fact
A :  "'cause" um they say say well i go home and think about it that will work
A :  Um
A :  Also mentioned was it should be
A :  Uh it it should have a very short learning curve
A :  And
A :  Maybe could be sold by using a slogan
A :  I'll or
A :  Technical manager have as then said that she feels it should have a chip
A :  That has infrared it's
A :  It's
A :  And it has an interface controls we interface controls the chip
A :  Therefore message is
A :  Uh will be controlled in the same manner
A :  They should be extra features like lead buttons maybe i'd be if too many buttons are pressed
A :  My uh child lock
A :  Um
A :  And uh maybe display clocks so that people could to um
A :  It could see the time you know what shall they want to watch
A :  Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes
A :  So the components of the things should be button bob hope's inferred the infrared bulb is battery chips liars
A :  And maybe some kind of a holder
A :  Uh for the for the uh uh item
A :  French you know who is an l. were
A :  Um
B :  Interface design
A :  Interface designer
A :  Oh um
A :  Uh uh has mentioned that's be there what we should have an on off button
A :  And also has mention an interesting features that each would have maybe a channel
A :  Particularly this may be small children that a quick and they're watching channel that is some desirable
A :  It would be compact for personal favourite was it would be t. shaped
A :  And maybe having a not a lot clock
A :  And the material should
A :  Possibly be in a lot of non allergic make sure
A :  Oh uh
A :  To different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio waves
A :  Yeah uh maybe it should have the electric electricity electricity saving
A :  Feature
D :  Sure
A :  And
A :  Even possibly a time or
A :  To so that people can prove i look at their favourite to uh uh
A :  Uh uh uh programme on the right from the remote
B :  Yes
A :  Um
A :  Are we all in agreement that that's that what we discussed last time
B :  Yes
A :  Okay
D :  Yeah i think that's pretty much is it yellow
A :  Uh okay then we i'm looking for three presentations and uh i don't know whether the order matters much uh i don't i don't think so also whoever wants
B :  Okay so uh
A :  Yeah okay
B :  Okay
B :  Um i slide please
A :  Okay yes i hate it's o. k.
A :  One was already
A :  And that's numbers it's too right
B :  Three
A :  Three
B :  That's true
B :  Yes
B :  Uh as an interface design uh i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote looks like
B :  So that it decided that it is attractive to customers
B :  Next
B :  Okay now the function of a remote is to send messages to the
B :  Television
B :  This message us could be uh switch on off mess age or switch to next channel and i say it was that being the channel it's a smidgen want to a particular channel like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine
A :  Nine what nine channel uh
A :  Switches
B :  Let me
A :  Nine channel switches
B :  Yes
A :  Yeah uh-huh
B :  Nine numbers
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And then you have smart thing um well but then
A :  Mm hmm
B :  But it's using which you can spot the channels if we don't want to see this touch and then we can stop it to the fort stanton always see worse so
B :  Then it should have an extra button and next back and channel that which you can keep on um uh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  The scrolling the channels one by one
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Next slide please
B :  Then you should have a button and that should that should get this can be used for increasing or decreasing the wall you
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Then they should be uh but then this can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a daily we should
B :  For example if you're watching the french programme and you would like to have as subtitles in english
D :  It's
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Then they should be a channel which can
B :  Did that this may can use them in the television so that the user can see
B :  Uh the yeah the subtitles on the screen
D :  Mm
B :  Then they should they they should be some buttons which can control features like the car no
B :  I dunno the picture uh the contrast sharpness brightness
B :  Of the picture
B :  No they should be a member of a switch
B :  They should be a mute to but then
B :  Suddenly if if if uh if you were he gets a telephone call it
B :  And if you want he doesn't want to switch on the
B :  Uh at t. v. but you you can read use the sound you can
B :  Bling that one him down and you can watch you can do it by talking you can watch the t. v.
B :  Not the most important feature i would like to have it might be more would be the speech recognition feature
B :  It's an integrated programme programmable sample sensor speaker you want it
B :  So i mean what can be it can be uh our design which can have the why selected an i. is it is
B :  You can record your own voice
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Which can be they could be nice to buy a otherwise recognise the in the television for example if you want to see we if we want to see them anchorage and then if you say just say nine standard
B :  Uh that that the the uh yeah the remote will automatically the switch to the mind john
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So the t. v. but have some recogniser which are recognise they use those whites and accordingly to change its functionalities
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
B :  So this is one one of the interface
B :  Which can be created
A :  Uh-huh
B :  As many simple interface which has all but uh uh important features
B :  But please next slide
A :  Uh-huh
B :  That these that some of their remotes which are different and shape and colour but they have many buttons
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So uh uh sometimes the use of finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design and interface which is really simple
B :  And it is user-friendly you when a kid can use that
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So can you want to uh to the next slide
B :  Yeah so this is one of the interface a lot of the remote which has this by voice of recognise that
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And this has multipurpose use it can be used for t. v. can be used for cable satellite it can be used for v. c. r. d. v. d.s and audio
B :  And this has in the twice recogniser
B :  Mm mm mm mm
B :  Yeah no this is an interface for that right uh for a remote uh uh uh which a child can use
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh this is user-friendly it's very attractive
B :  The children can use that as well as they can play with that
B :  And this comes with different
B :  But as different shapes
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And this this such i did uh interface as a minimum buttons
B :  And all the important
B :  Uh buttons are that in this small compact
B :  Attractive
B :  Tried interface
B :  Thanks light please
B :  But that's as uh bank
A :  Okay
B :  Well what size remote which cannot be misplaced but it's impossible to misplace i i
D :  I
A :  I
D :  Yeah i know made i.
A :  Yeah yeah yeah
C :  I
A :  I
D :  I can do is that and then it i
B :  This is i
B :  You have a very very good i never got it
B :  But these are the the way that was the remote control uh it's important but do you do is raise are loose
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So so the lambs that's interface which can be created
B :  And the plus the prefer it's
B :  Uh would be s. p. uh uh or to incorporate speech recogniser is
B :  Uh that's the response to use this voice for the particular uh function
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Thank you that's
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Oh okay thank you very much uh any comments on the presentation
D :  No um that's that we still have quite a twice things out there
D :  Um what uh
D :  And you know suggestions that but uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more i don't think that we can get
D :  Uh oh
D :  To to shape is good the channel one is good
D :  Too too big to misplace i think it's it's funny i
D :  I am i i i think that's gonna be our impulse perch it's at that i cannot cannot it's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy yeah
A :  I i i think
B :  There are a bit
A :  No i think say these are presentations but uh uh uh as far as a decision making week getting to that after after but if i totally know whether anybody had any uh any anything to add to uh for presentation
D :  Yeah uh-huh
D :  Had to come back to that later okay
B :  We can
C :  Yeah
D :  No i think a presentation was good and she really explored all the options
A :  Right
A :  Uh-huh
A :  How was the one next to um
C :  Yeah okay
A :  Mm okay and you
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh okay
C :  Uh the next one so
A :  Oops
C :  Mm
A :  The components design uh-huh
A :  Yeah okay
C :  Um
C :  This time um i'm going to um
C :  Concentrate more on the components
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And the technical side of the remote control of design
C :  Uh oh
C :  I have just a breeze
C :  Uh don few of components which we require for the remote control uh construction
C :  Uh the first one is case
C :  To keep all the components like integrated suck you would battery it's a fact that writes like
C :  Uh well it can be a plastic one
C :  Hard plastic
C :  So that it can be struck even if you just uh well you know if you if it falls down then it doesn't three so it should be strong
A :  Mm
C :  And uh um they are more harmful materials used in that
C :  And it should be recycled but
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Ah and uh uh
D :  Uh-huh good point
C :  Yeah and also are using of cutting component components like uh if we want to have different colours blue red green
C :  So uh uh we have to use a some kind of a call on the component components
C :  And uh the second important thing is that uh it uh integrated thank you
C :  Um the sure we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote control it if it is not the fish and then everything but it's going to be uh like a then if it's less efficient so it you should be should have a highly sophisticated one
D :  Mm
D :  You
C :  And it should be racist into high as well as uh low temperatures suppose if it is thirty degrees outside forty degrees outside it should
D :  Mm
C :  It should it be able to address is the the temperature uh
C :  Hi so uh
C :  I can listen to it is
C :  I know it should be with a um a paper that it's time uh an alarm facility
C :  And they all are the
C :  Opening we should uh be have in the remote control or is that a sister
C :  Oh
C :  Which is like uh it it is very very much important for the electricity uh fiddle to to to the remote controller and also a capacitator which is "'em"
D :  Mm
D :  Mm
C :  It is and i think it's it's like a battery capacity
C :  You go on to the next slide please
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Well i do you want
C :  A transvestite
C :  I've resonator
C :  These are all this that technical uh in the electronic components of components which at which we have to use in the remote control it
D :  Mm
C :  A battery uh i would like to say just one thing uh if we
C :  Uh if we will be able to me "'cause" least a rechargeable battery can be should be need not go for our high-performance battery
D :  Hmm
C :  Even if it is a mobile phones battery it quite can't you can't charge much it it it's not that how you would expect you can also we can
C :  If it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time so in that way we can cut cut the cost but it yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  That we have to me the battery as recharge one
C :  And we we have a circuit board
C :  Uh in a remote control but you could
C :  Thank you
C :  And how it works how the remote controller works
C :  When you press a button
A :  Why
C :  Well when you press a button when you do that
C :  You complete a specific connection that means a menu
C :  When you press a button that will be uh it's it's more it's a cute
C :  And that me the button and it will send some signals through the wires
C :  And then at the chip will sense that connection and most that data but it is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have test
C :  Than the old the chip but you know that the number one
C :  But then was placed it was it produces a morse a morse code line signal specific to that button
C :  Every button and the individual button has it's a one more school suppose the the well use it has pressed a button button one then it would have a spare the circuit will generate a specific morse code to it
C :  But that that button
C :  And the transistor that amplify the signal and the l. e. d.
C :  Which translates the signal into infrared light
C :  Make you have got a signal
C :  By pressing the button
C :  That that at a morse code has been generated like they did it it's like you
C :  Now that signal that morse code has to be amplified but the transistor that is the use of transistor transistor be which we use in the remote control that amplify the signal and it will send it to the e. d. and which translates the signal into an inset infrared bits
C :  That's inside and the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal
C :  Seen the signal three it reacts appropriately that we need c.s that amplify that more morse code signal that it it up it will uh will know which what what actually it has to
C :  But do then it will do the appropriate action
C :  So uh this is how the remote controller works
C :  Yeah thanks
C :  Yeah i have few pictures when you look at the uh the old remote control it well it's it's it this is a normal remote control that
D :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And and the next one please
C :  And they'll be hard to have a few buttons and not
C :  And uh if you open the remote control or you have this set you said keyboard and few electronic components like it you can see a chip
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
C :  There we just have been eating games and also our capacity of capacity or three or sisters and also of resonator
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Oh um
C :  Hmm yeah
C :  And that and the day or transistors
C :  The electronic components the on off the top of the components have all those uh things like chip that they would
C :  Transistors
C :  Yeah they um can you uh you can see the t. v. a. double one eight three five really believe that uh it cheap
A :  Hmm
B :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yes
C :  Um
C :  Uh you can also see the the the drinking too many things are uh these at the at the at the sisters and it just decide that you can see a transistor and uh well uh still in the shape of a bad one is a capacitator
C :  Uh and also they are all this is to say uh sorry they they said they would
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Can you
C :  So uh this is this the keyboard the green one is a circuit board
C :  Actually uh building the circuit board board is pretty pretty easy and also it's uh it's an inexpensive
C :  Uh it's it costs less than what you print of the people
C :  Because i uh well when you when you are building a son
C :  It's a keywords some of those are cute and also wires it's it's better to go for printing because it you can build these kind of
C :  Circuit boards on a on a button and it's just printing nothing like oh you know you don't need to use by it's not it's not exactly why as we are using it's just thinking something on a board
C :  That do those prints would act act as a biased and so that's a keeps
C :  So would that be in a row think it is is the keyboard and also you can see uh there and it's like all of the axis four buttons
C :  Make it then you press a button
C :  That's a cute and the the button will be activated it will it will uh get some signals from it
C :  And it will uh it with chi it's just a send the signal signals to the be um integrated circuit
C :  Uh so this is these are the sake you sell and and they need the buttons
C :  Uh can you see the black are from mars they they are so cute
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yes
C :  And um
C :  Like i'll be have a design but before we have seen some uh a few things like that instead of buttons we have some schools
C :  Um but i have a push button requires a simple chip and that needed but we have the scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range a course controls we have to go for that
D :  Mm
D :  Yes
C :  Sophisticated and uh uh for the complete chip
C :  Uh and uh as energy source we all for the basic battery
C :  Um orange and use a hard dynamo
C :  Um
C :  I kinda provision of energy
C :  More than what is that you shake actually to provide energy so with that also we can have an uh back to be
D :  Yeah
C :  Um or they can use solar cells
D :  Uh that's interesting
C :  Um
C :  Yeah
C :  Uh yeah the product can be the uh delivered into different cases
C :  Uh usually the case is an card flats that of a v. c. usually uh uh or not my remote control it
C :  Um
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah
A :  And you have more pictures uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
C :  Oh yeah maybe i have just one more slide think
C :  Um
C :  Like we can have all made me to use that as plastic rubber wood titanium but i can be kind to you
C :  Um and also for the electronics we can use a simple and they give the of the i. r. or an advanced chip on print
C :  Um also in so it includes the infrared sender sender
C :  Um yeah and for the movie just give it up uh sample sensors speaker
C :  Sample speaker
C :  Yeah
C :  So for now
A :  Okay well thank you
A :  Any particular comments by anybody
D :  Uh yeah on the scroll-wheel pushbutton
D :  Um can you can achieve scrolling by repeated be pushing a button
C :  No no the the the the scrolling was a a different like you can go first is which is like buttons or scrolls
D :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh it which which we used to do before ten ten years before like you know nobody uses it because you need you need a uh
D :  Mm
C :  Sophisticated chip and also i think it's better be go for uh ordinary buttons
D :  And
D :  We discover push buttons for in the interest of costly okay
C :  Yeah you have pushbuttons yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present for
D :  Okay in the right to lifers my next slide
A :  Or uh thing
A :  Uh okay
D :  Um
D :  Right mind that the that is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing
D :  And i wanna see how we can make our sauce different from the competition so
D :  I i've really be um looking at the press and the ads that are out there for a remote controllers
D :  I spy and spend a lot of time on the internet um sitting around doing the same thing
D :  And then one out um people's houses or meetings or anything like that
D :  I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have
D :  And if it can be in conversation i ask about it now and encourage you all to do the same
D :  Um
D :  And my findings from this is the you know small is beautiful
D :  Um people like something that really fits in your hand
B :  Yeah it's
D :  Simple was beautiful they don't want to have to square it small print um they want buttons to use functions are obvious
D :  And they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing
D :  They want each button to do something they are eye-catching is important it's gotta look you it's gotta look appealing okay i don't think that's that's for you
D :  Um
D :  And are preferences as far as i'm concerned are we gotta get to the market before the competition as has to be
D :  Look really great and it has to come out before the others that we have a light up on time to sell it for should be for other people get out there christmas item
D :  And we should develop one or two features we can really do well on an ad campaign if we try to sell people are there's too many great features
D :  Um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere so you've got a narrower selection down to one and two things i think that we're gonna say are really great about our our our new product
D :  And i've been looking around um at what designed every year different things are popular
D :  And in my research this you have an update fruit and vegetables it's a really popular
D :  And you were tired of hard plastic and hard metal they're more back into saw feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on um so those are things that we wanna look at is for is still ability of the item
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  That's
A :  Concludes presentation of everyone
A :  And what we we have to see side in this meeting is
A :  Um
A :  A concept of the remote
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And uh the
A :  So what do we think
A :  On the concept
A :  Of the remote
D :  You wanna try to come back to where is the mm the material and
B :  Yeah yeah so i would like to include this feature which is call this voice recogniser
D :  Okay
A :  Oh okay
A :  Uh-huh
D :  So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned
C :  Yeah
B :  This could be uh one feature which could be sellable
D :  Yeah like that could that could be a rest are feature that that won't be really good yeah i agree with that
A :  I think that's
A :  Uh-huh
C :  But but other than of a remote stop for the whole whole
C :  Uh find it very well
C :  Because the speech recogniser click it has it
C :  One uh uh
D :  This this problem
C :  So this issue
C :  Yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognise single person's what it's like maybe different people will be having different voices so
D :  Mm
D :  Yeah
C :  Would like to have it
A :  Well you you teach you have to teach i i
B :  Okay
C :  So did a good ticket know recognising system that's a
B :  No it's it's a yeah it's it's like you're recording oh well on uh um a question already
C :  I think i see
B :  And then you're expecting an answer from for example you have a t. v. system i'm the user
C :  Uh-huh
B :  And my family members that they use that i will already the cord
C :  Yeah but uh yeah
B :  Up a a question like
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Oh good morning like around eight o'clock on want to see the news in the television so i say it is good morning and that you switch on it to recognise my wise
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  And the switch on
A :  Okay before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy
A :  What kind of energy do we
A :  For c.
D :  I think i think battery and i think we all agree on that that that's that's gonna be most cost effective than the best thing
A :  Battery
A :  Battery
B :  Actually
C :  Yeah battery
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay then a chip on print
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Nice
A :  Okay
A :  And the case and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something or uh or maybe bright colour fall
C :  Yeah
D :  Right colour for all trendy trendy design and strong now
B :  And on that
C :  And also strong
C :  I
B :  Trendy design and compact
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Then you design compact and strong
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes
A :  User interface concept
A :  Uh the interface type supplements
A :  L. p. you were area i think right yeah
C :  Uh
C :  Oh
C :  Like switches like we use buttons for user interface
B :  Pushbuttons
A :  For that
C :  Pushbuttons yes
A :  I guess uh for yeah
A :  And
A :  I'm not sure what they mean by supplements
C :  Yeah
B :  Someone is like different types of features buttons
D :  Well i think
D :  Yeah or uh
B :  You can have a new but uh
A :  Oh like
D :  Well like uh speech recognition would also be a supplement for her speech recognition feature would be a supplement
C :  Yeah really
B :  Oh to live in that and
A :  Oh
A :  A what
A :  Right right right uh-huh
B :  Recogniser yes
D :  Okay so why we put down speech recognition if possible paintings more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is
A :  Right
B :  Yes
A :  Okay and uh uh uh
D :  Eh
A :  Oh next meeting will be in thirty minutes and it be
A :  Oh uh
A :  I. d. is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then
A :  To have to look and feel design
A :  And are uh to u. i. d. is supposed to
A :  Uh come up with a user interface design
C :  Uh-huh
A :  And the marketing expert with a product evaluation
D :  Okay
A :  In this phase that two of you only an hour and a fancy in have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
A :  It says here
A :  You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
B :  Okay
A :  Um if you have any questions you know you
A :  You can always uh contact me
A :  Um or uh or you coach i suppose
A :  I
D :  I
D :  Where are they hiding i i i
A :  Uh then
A :  So um i think we can put a meeting here and we come back in the uh write us thirty minutes according to our timetable here
B :  Okay
A :  Thank you were
C :  Thank you
B :  Thank you
A :  I think
A :  No
D :  But
