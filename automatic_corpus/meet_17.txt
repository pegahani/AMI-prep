C :  Yeah that would be i went to put their first feed
C :  The second people always be when they do
C :  Come to that position the second the court feet would be there
C :  That's the way they walk
C :  And that's very peculiar board that none of the other remotes for like this
C :  And they really useful tool human beings at least
C :  If you will feel hundred years ago and there was no means of transportation so something
C :  All then they had a k. i. d.
C :  She would you the notes from one place to another difference whether we use or
C :  And they have on dunno
C :  Usually the one countries

C :  That's what i know what them as well
C :  That's what i want to have a look at once
B :  So is is uh in in you know enough the canal from "'cause" even drawn ideas
C :  There are two all kind of uh yeah yeah read it from
C :  In the in an african elephants
C :  So in in in different design one one i thing and a half we can have to
C :  And then there's a difference in the trunk all the animals these an defensible or indian and

B :  You can discuss that off line
A :  Yeah we discussed of off line or do we do it doesn't meeting about on a difference
C :  Thanks
A :  Okay
A :  So
A :  So those are important part of the product is about it's not a
A :  Ah i am about
A :  It's all about finances so i'll uh-huh
A :  We should all get saying price of twenty five euro for these remote control
A :  And uh we have um yeah which which you generate a profit off off
A :  Uh fifty million euro it's
A :  Okay and we should target the internet and international market
B :  So just lost
B :  One question um
B :  Is this the stand alone unit that we're gonna be selling so it's gonna be you ready have a t. v. but you buying an extra remote control for something
A :  But this is the next topic was to discuss exactly
B :  Okay
A :  So let's go to it
A :  So um
A :  We should decide which kind of remote control to uh we want to want to go should be should shouldn't be um specific remote control to some specific jurors should it be a universal one
A :  And the uh extra
A :  So um
A :  So
A :  I'm watching for you or
A :  We need that's very quickly because we have only
A :  Three three minutes to go
B :  Okay well
B :  So
B :  It seems the
B :  The first thing that they've gone so as far as the price like
B :  Based on how much for for we wanna make which seems to
B :  And a little strange we don't know what the the prices yeah but i guess if that's if that's a requirement that we need to
B :  Did is on the
B :  The product actually fit that
B :  That price bracket so uh
B :  I guess we don't need to find out what's actually
B :  You know what people are willing to pay for
B :  Um what kind of part they're expecting for twenty five euro because it seems quite a lot for remote control so it's
A :  Okay
A :  Okay i think this is more or drop to work or markets
C :  Marketing thoughts on
A :  But um yeah
A :  So
A :  It should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting is to have an overview of these
A :  And uh well
A :  In which direction we should go so we need to close the meeting
