D :  Yeah
B :  It is it
A :  This is
D :  Mm
B :  Sure
A :  I saw it
A :  Okay
C :  And you look like for me and stuff like that
A :  You can stay seated for years
C :  Yeah
C :  He these things
D :  How
D :  That's a great opportunity then
D :  To learn how to be patient
C :  I'm saying
A :  It's a new thing so and then
D :  Yeah that's
B :  Sorry for all the sun boss a couple the tech guys can be
B :  All the laid there
A :  Sorry i understand yeah so more uh
B :  That's right we certainly do
C :  Boss
A :  Me and the technical enough to walk or clap
A :  Clearly doesn't work
A :  This thing
D :  Yeah we yeah well your project manager an hour
D :  Directly do it
A :  Well that's meant to be in there
D :  Ah
A :  I see
D :  Oh
A :  Oh no it claps
D :  Yeah i'm
B :  Ah it's um it's a
A :  So good
D :  Well
A :  She's guys
A :  So
A :  We
A :  Are you have to talk about functional design
A :  No hopefully we've all got better idea from
A :  Then we did for leading the last meeting as to what
A :  It is we're up to now
A :  So he's an agenda
A :  Um i'll open and you shouldn't all that i'll be taking minutes channel meetings as a was showing to last time
A :  Uh and i'll be easier from in addition not actually giving the whole presentation
A :  Uh the different ones are just the stuff that was sent in the eye for that on from upper management having a few bright idea is to
A :  Make a noise painful
A :  Um
A :  Mary
A :  You can all give your presentations we can talk about the comments
A :  And hopefully come to some decisions
A :  At four minutes for this meeting so that more time than last one
A :  Is the additional points just wanted to put those and they have to see if you guys had any comments
A :  On them
A :  Uh do you all received an email
D :  Yeah
A :  So then have any overall
D :  What
D :  It what comes up for me is that if we're gonna
D :  If we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh
D :  Having
D :  No teletext people are very comfortable with
D :  The idea of having teletext in using teletext
D :  And so we're not we're gonna be
D :  A new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now so that's from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack
D :  And so we have to go i think in the other direction what are we gonna have that makes this thing
A :  Well that that possibly could also be enough opportunity because and saying that teletext becoming addicted
A :  Some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is an opportunity that presented i guess
D :  Yeah no i i agree with you so what i'm talking about is i see that once i were them in a sound thing so we have to come up with another side which is what are we gonna be targeting our market
D :  Uh that identifies our product is better than because it doesn't have teletext it has that that that
D :  So that's that's that was my reaction is
A :  Yeah but but we are so it being dictated that this should only be used for the tell them to look like that
A :  So we really probably and i'm the marketing are looking for something that's
A :  Yeah that's a cost wanna rather than a
A :  Fantastic new feature product
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah but but what we're designing or the remote not design the t. v.
A :  Hmm
C :  So uh we gonna be removing the teletext out of any t. v.
C :  We people use a remote that
D :  That's right and it would take that yeah
C :  Kind of steep
A :  But there's also the potential for mark it as a market here for lost a bit
A :  For example some and it just goes to the shop the ones the replacement
A :  What's this
A :  It's possible twenty five euros a selling price
A :  We really have to innovate yeah i guess
D :  That's uh that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product is somebody some people are gonna be happy unhappy "'cause" it to make it had access to teletext
D :  Okay
D :  "'cause" we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there
D :  Are are teletext
A :  Yeah
D :  So so it's it's not in criticising the product and all it's just when we eliminate getting what do we bring
D :  What are we bringing to take the place of this and we have to do it might mean we have the double up if we lose one we need to bring to
D :  Or three
A :  Okay i think that the last point is probably quite so uh
A :  Stay for obesity
A :  D.
A :  We it has to be branded
C :  So the the double r. will be on or
A :  On the product yeah
B :  I think what uh
A :  Can you had a lot black and yellow
C :  I think well what walls was my mind but the war
B :  I think yeah what the things that we should also keep in mind um when we doing this i mean our company slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right
B :  So i think are kind of our target here it is to
B :  Have some kind of very like sleek nice looking remote and we want it to be functional as well but i think one of the main selling points is it
B :  We don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here you know we don't wanna big
B :  Cocker want something that looks nice and
B :  It's fashionable mm
B :  So
D :  To have this
A :  So we have three presentations and i think bold one
A :  Or or or participant number here
A :  So we can have a look at the working design for
A :  I'm participant two parts
C :  Yes
A :  Hmm
B :  That's fine
B :  Okay so
A :  That to click on that
B :  So you'll know mean i'm the industrial designer
B :  And with some basic components that
B :  Uh my remote is gonna need just basically every remote mean we need some kind of power power source
B :  Um
B :  We have to decide and our our user interface which is his department that in user interface is also a major component
B :  Um we need a uh programmable digital signal processors to um
B :  To take the input from user and translate that into a
B :  Into electronics signal which we passed to the
B :  Infrared l. e. d. which you aim at the television which indeed receives that signal
B :  Yeah and off switch um and get in there
B :  And that we also need to
B :  Um have the
B :  If we wanna universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes it a t. v.s
B :  So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so require some memory as well
B :  Um so here's just the basic layout of how
B :  How the remote would work
B :  You had the the power sources in the upper right hand corner there and you can see that
B :  Uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all are signal processing
B :  And then passes that signal on to the
B :  Infrared l. e. d. and that signal is animated and received by the television
B :  For the transistor
B :  So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much
B :  Oh open to move around
D :  That is would just be considered just a standard the
D :  Um
B :  I think any to
D :  Is that this is not cutting edge technology were talking here we're talking about existing technology
B :  Right i think
D :  Nothing's been modified they're upgraded or
B :  Yeah this is it
D :  The discovers
B :  This is just the basic layout about that all the components that we
B :  Alright gonna be absolutely necessary to have are working remote we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition
B :  I mean that
B :  I mean they you can kind of say would
B :  Would fall under the user interface and the visual signal processing chip
D :  Okay
A :  Do we have an i. d. of course of different components
B :  Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh
B :  It could also basically the user interface and the casing a gonna be expensive as well um
B :  The l. e. d. and that the transistors and everything else or you know they're they're pretty cheap
B :  So depending on what we wanna functionality to be
B :  Um the chip could be expensive or could be cheap
B :  Um dependent on my memory we need in there and stuff like that and and what you know
A :  You have any ball park figures for that yeah yeah
B :  Oh i don't have any figures right now
B :  We we have to wait for you get to a more specific design phase for that
B :  Um
B :  And i think it's significant part the costs could be the actual
B :  The actual casing itself and and you know the
B :  The the buttons and things like that
D :  Sure
B :  Yeah basically yeah
B :  So yeah that's all i have really
A :  Okay thanks
A :  Mm yeah
A :  This and you should leave it at all
C :  I
A :  You you click on
C :  Well it's
D :  Uh-huh
C :  But
A :  You mean yeah
C :  We are fighting over it was a more fun
A :  You slide show
A :  Wait a minute yeah
A :  It's gotta be a
B :  But uh yeah
C :  Uh
A :  Okay
C :  That's the way
C :  So yeah function design um
C :  You guys know we can draw and um
C :  What a phone is
C :  We
C :  Want to do fashion and i think honestly
C :  We should keep technology low and just
C :  Simple basically and
C :  Try to aim for design
C :  Basically a case for
C :  Will cost the same if it looks good or bad
C :  So we might we have to make it look good
C :  Um
C :  Something
C :  Cutest small the the big chain two remotes are dieting v. a. v. so
C :  We should just go for something
C :  That people like to actually look at
C :  And um
C :  Well we mow most people will buy a
C :  Televisions and everything for the have walls holes a little functions and everything
C :  And then was the end up using simple
C :  Functions a little things and
C :  Most people want wanna get to amount of actually having to go to the
C :  Just to the television into for instance team in
C :  They're stations
C :  There's no need to have them the remote
C :  So um
C :  Um
C :  As for what i would recommend for uh
C :  Um the interface design and uh i will change the colours and uh
C :  On the logo
C :  But
C :  Um we should go for the user oriented device so simple controls and
C :  Good ergonomics
C :  Um and now all the last last time still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i guess
C :  But um we should go for that
A :  But i think what they demand and recommendation was less that there's a way that teletext would become outdated rather than we shouldn't have that
A :  So i i still think of it cheap enough
A :  Functionality waste include it really should be in there
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Because otherwise we're just going to me
A :  Even if it's necessary or not if you if you're given the choice between the two uh remote west don't think so without
A :  Uh when it really
A :  If it if it isn't
A :  More expensive
A :  For a stick
A :  Make it because it's that is understand it it can be operated at the same set of buttons yeah
B :  Right as far as
A :  So it should be in there
B :  It's just that the cost of an extra button i mean software rise there's really no difference
A :  Okay is that
D :  I have maybe a silly question like in a very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers is gonna be
D :  It's gonna be outmoded teletext i don't understand how those two things are connected
D :  How this have is computers and teletext
D :  Hell why is one eliminating the need of the other i don't understand that
A :  Well maybe what we're getting two years be the ideal of uh and connect to the t. v. for example
A :  So that might play on what we can
C :  Yeah the the the uh basically aiming at saint that you use in a couple years ago teletext be the easiest way to check like for uh
B :  Scheduling
C :  Yeah the scandal ridden in the next programme and stuff like that i know
B :  And to find out what what you're watching even if it's commercials you know
D :  Okay
C :  And uh you can look at it internet but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities
B :  I have
D :  Yeah "'cause" yeah i just i don't see the cross over three computers in television i mean i didn't see you cross over in some sense
C :  It's not happen yeah
D :  Well but but
D :  That the remote is it is used for television okay so so if we make the cross over in we're gonna be television on computers in word them are losing the the necessity of the remote
A :  Go away
A :  Well there there is that for example that useful t. v. systems you have you can press a button then you can buy things in a drought and you can uh you can use your catalogue for example it a family member mean he's got system where you just
A :  Um
A :  You can and the and there's other features for example another system so you can pause like t. v. and things it that it just features from the internet
A :  Uh from computers that are coming into the t. v.s are under the covers
A :  But you still use it to a teletext so
D :  Okay
A :  Other things to think here of that
A :  The there's gonna be more functionality
C :  Yeah but we we don't we know naming a command for that
A :  Potentially
C :  That's the thing and all those require at the commands with more complexity and more software
B :  But i think a lot is proprietary anyways you're not gonna be able to
B :  The command it to you know with a remote i don't think
A :  But still that is an option see if if it's for example trainable one then we just simply having we can up down left right
A :  An okay button or something and um eight
A :  Me too as well and future person yeah
C :  Yeah well we would increase the price to try to make a trigger want so
A :  Okay
C :  Well i dunno one way or the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or you know make two separate
B :  I think it's possible you should try to
C :  Interface designs
B :  You know how to talk with the management about that
B :  Just you know
D :  Yeah i i don't i don't see the logic
D :  I i don't see a lot you can elimination teletext uh just a
A :  Yeah and neither
D :  But i'm not attack a minute i just don't see the crossover between computers and and
D :  It were designing something for television
A :  A communique that back to those guys the and the the the message really wanna be sending to them is that a little teletext may become outdated
A :  There's no what what you can not having it in there anyway
A :  Uh if it doesn't affect the price
B :  It's just that
D :  We're selling it to an existing market
A :  Um
A :  That i think for the pushing us towards year is in terms of thinking of we used to
A :  Feature prefer system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe
C :  Yeah well we're not
A :  Uh no no no
C :  Some that's not not putting anything in in the place of teletext
D :  Yeah and and yeah and and we're also marketing a product that's what i'm saying is is a mid range cost product
C :  It's a problem
D :  So uh so what we can go and pump a whole bunch technology in the same because all of a sudden we're gonna have cost overruns so if we drop if we're gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes a marketable
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So for keeping it basic
A :  Rubble of what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh
A :  Just being very easy to use looking exceptionally good that sort of thing
A :  "'cause" we really don't have anything else the the
D :  I don't i don't see it and to me if i'm gonna market a product for for beauty
D :  For for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market a a much higher price i need to make it special with a high price tag
D :  I don't wanna make it economically at a competitive i want i want to market it as exclusive so i would market this product at at eighty nine euros and come up with some really
D :  Beautiful exterior design something
A :  It's cheap and functionalities basic then
A :  Twenty five years is probably a high a price for a commoner gardens down standard t. v.s the place
A :  Uh remote that then the place we're going to
A :  Justify that costs is to to design to making it uh
A :  A sleek elegant
A :  Hi traced
A :  Basic remote
A :  Is that makes a
D :  No i know i i i understand what you say well what i'm what i'm okay
D :  We probably need to move along but my my
A :  Yeah probably should
D :  To find a marketing niche for this product and if i'm coming in with that
D :  With with twenty five euros which is made market price
D :  Um
D :  V. and what am i going to give these people for this
A :  Yeah
D :  So that's just my question we can keep talking
A :  Okay
A :  So it can it and see the
C :  No this is our that would that the kids would be a teletext and those would be the basic commands
C :  Um as for um really the case design uh maybe a come up with more
C :  A good ideas right now is just the idea of
C :  Simplicity and
C :  So we can skip did small
B :  I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there how many people
B :  How many people actually
B :  Use every feature that are you know it like these trainable remotes and things like that
B :  Where you know what it's just so confusing to do a lot to use all these functions work
B :  I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost the t. v. remote they need another one that'll work with their t. v. they want something that looks nice that that that isn't gonna break when you drop it
B :  You know that maybe it's it's ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that i think that's gonna be were you're gonna find the biggest you know market share
A :  So we're looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features
B :  I think the more bells and whistles we had it's just gonna cut into our entire profits because i think it's week is we
B :  Add cost for things like a
B :  For like if we had the voice recognition and things like that
B :  I think you know what percentage of the of the um
B :  Of the market is actually gonna use that
B :  I percent
A :  But we can talk a little bit more potential in the market and i think presentation of us
B :  And how much
B :  Yeah okay sir
A :  Be a good idea
A :  As uh the mute right
B :  It's our boss
A :  And not the boss
A :  Okay
D :  Well they do i just wanna say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles uh huh
C :  We'll have
D :  You know so um things come to my mind is uh
D :  Uh something that's uh um voice activated
D :  I know we're getting in this and uh some big money on this thing
A :  I think that's probably crash more for
D :  Yeah for over here
A :  This guy here yeah
D :  Okay alright
B :  Well it's kind of also sees user user interface
D :  "'cause" i think a voice activated i think of of
D :  How many times i've i've lost my my remote i can't find it
D :  So some way that i can i can find my remote by
D :  Clapping my hands or something
B :  Yeah lights off
A :  Hmm
D :  Um and and so uh so um
D :  But that's just something i'm trying to find some bells and whistles "'cause" we may talk about tell it taking out teletext is like what are we gonna put in what makes this thing attractive and it's only for television it's
D :  So we every are our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use them for their v. c. r.s or d. v. d.s there
D :  Their televisions in were coming out with one remote for television only
D :  And so to me we have to make it a really special product i i i don't i really had to say i don't see the market niche for this product at this price i don't see it yeah and like i go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market but i i don't see the market niche for this product
A :  Hmm
D :  Without without some really some something really special identified as as unique in the market
C :  Well we did that should be designed
D :  Yeah
C :  That should be the design basically
C :  I think technology would be would not in the price range to do it
C :  We don't have the money to do it
C :  Towards the technology so we should we should aim at the
D :  It's a do you have to do it in the box
D :  Okay well
D :  So so that's up to you than just to make this box and something that's just absolutely extraordinaire
D :  Maybe make it in a form would go and we can sell in united states
C :  Yeah
A :  I have a question for the year it does any of these
A :  Um the features
A :  That that was talking about here
A :  Have any implications we make not for the one in terms of just pure functionality
A :  That's amazing or cut the cost of that or
B :  I don't
B :  I think all these things are pretty standard i think will be okay
A :  Cheers
A :  And
D :  Right
A :  You all
D :  You know for marketing for
D :  Marketing for me is uh
D :  And i have a are here okay
B :  And you can use
D :  Cool
B :  No no no it just get off that you just click anywhere
D :  They right
D :  Ah
D :  Yeah what for me is that um
D :  I i don't know what i'm marketing right now okay so you spoken when i wrote this i don't know what i'm marketing i just know they like i was identified as a
D :  That we identify ourselves as a as a developer as a manufacturer and as a as a a distributed to other wholesalers
D :  And so the of the twenty five euros that we've identified
D :  Has the sale price is a wholesale price
D :  Rather than a retail price that's what we decided here
D :  Um
D :  So what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in in a sense can market itself so what we've identified here as our main marketing strategy and is is in design we're making the most beautiful attractive
D :  Uh whatever we decided this
D :  So that means we have about seven more minutes ten minutes left
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Um so
D :  I would like to have a product that that we can still easily so i said uh inspiration so having something beauty something attractive
D :  Uh something that in a sense will sell itself
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh innovation i think fits in the what we're talking about here with design
D :  Are cutting edge technology i don't think we're gonna have that these were ideas i was putting together
D :  Um
D :  Unless we come up with some new age product uh as far as the casing is concerned
D :  I wanna make this thing something that i can identify a special in some way
D :  So maybe we can have some uh i talked about environmentally sensitive
D :  Uh maybe we have a product that can be identified and some way as advantageous in the whole
D :  I don't know
D :  These are just thoughts
D :  Uh i wanted to talk about
D :  Uh we we are as a as a corporation that word new we're aggressive were competitive we're we're trying to provide a product
D :  From a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line so to me it's about selling that
D :  How our identity our corporate identity along with the product
D :  Um what i've found is that the projected cost a competitive
D :  Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market
D :  But what i'm saying is that the market is ready for i i identified new technology but again because what i see as budget restrictions and limitations
D :  I don't know that we can bring any new technology and it's a if if we could have
D :  A technological
D :  Something
B :  I have an idea
D :  That place
B :  "'s" and it's kind of along those lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit in the ergonomics
B :  And even kind of
B :  Address the issue of losing
B :  Losing the remote what we're saying that's the kind an issue
B :  Um well we can do is well you know that batteries throwing away rose run two batteries like crazy
D :  Mm
D :  Oh
B :  And
D :  So
B :  So for some people yeah
B :  Well maybe not a solar
B :  Instead what about if we had like a power cradle
B :  Like at a cradle that is is there to hold a remote when you're not using it so you always know where the remote is "'cause" you have to put it back there to charge the remote and we can instead of having instead of having you know replaceable batteries or just have a power sell that stays there for like for the remote
B :  You never have to get go through the
B :  Go through
B :  Uh all these different batteries and
B :  Also you can i i think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for now just for the user design but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole
B :  You know you could have some kind of
B :  Need little
B :  You know
B :  Uh sexy design for a cradle in the remote itself
D :  Why i like it i like the idea but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double
B :  It will it will increase the car
D :  But what we can sell this thing because it's know batteries it's environmentally sensitive and we can identify it is a safer product and some form
B :  And you could page the remote if you lose it maybe there's a button on the cradle
D :  Yeah that's right
D :  I really see
A :  No that
A :  Mess can we make this for less than twelve fifty
D :  No no we have we have to change it in cost is uh
A :  Guess i'll have to change the end cost because
A :  Uh it
A :  Can we do can we do that without
A :  Uh the changing it twelve fifty per product if we basically can sell more based on that
D :  Yeah that's gonna be at these guys right
D :  My reaction is no way
B :  What i can do is i can look into the how well paid and i can look and how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of affect an increase cost is gonna have on their uh final numbers
A :  Yeah we can satellite dish for a more expensive product
D :  See i i i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product
A :  That's gonna be
D :  You know let's that sell this thing wholesale for for fifty euros
D :  Two euros let's make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive a high-tech design uh ergonomics all of this just make just saying uh
D :  Yeah the the the rolls royce of of remote controls
B :  I i
D :  Everyone's got to if you don't have one cable kinda remote you have oh you've got one of those i'll fantastic i want one of those two i just don't have enough money right now
B :  I just don't know about that because in order to do that in order to price it it that kind of well i think we'd need to have
B :  Every
B :  Functionality that all the other competitors are offering like
B :  Being able to operate you know the d. v. d. player and you know the stereo system and all that which is a pretty basic function know we use up that out of
B :  And additionally you were maybe not supporting teletext
B :  Um
A :  No i think we can say with certainty know that we are supporting so
B :  Uh i do think there's some basic features that we don't have a lot of other
B :  Remotes are going to have
D :  Yep want one thing i don't understand is they've they've given us this package okay
D :  Yeah out uh in my opinion we need to give them the package back okay they say they say okay you you go they go that's a fundamental foundation of of what they want
D :  And and well it's a place you can analyse know that you i i don't think it's our place to create a product for that maybe this i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder
D :  Uh but to me is like well kate you actually get out ideas okay and then let them look at those ideas nay saying yeah well we can we can raise the price twenty percent
D :  You know we like this idea this idea no but it to me it it's it's about a choice do we follow the directives or do we make a
D :  Presentations back and and then and then discuss
D :  Can i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing
D :  Handing out right now i don't see it
B :  Um i i'd i have to disagree though i think our market niches basically
B :  People who need it
B :  Who've lost their remote or are have broken the remote
B :  And don't wanna send back to the manufacturer to just wanna run out the store and get a remote and then they're gonna look and the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote it does what they need design
B :  I i think that
A :  And and that to get it back then other points uh it for coding in that so i think it's important to remember that
A :  That this remote has to work with multiple t. v.s you have to selling and it's one it's not one be specifically for that actually t. v.s or or
D :  No i understand that
A :  It's all
A :  Technologically if i understand that
A :  At t. v.s
A :  T. v. remote walking exactly the same way that you remotes and d. v. d. remotes
A :  Well you need to do is train them to the individual one or all you need to do is is know what they do have like some forward record it's all saying that works with all t. v.s is equivalent to saying but what with
A :  D. v. d.s
D :  No they've identified the product is not working for anything with television they like
C :  You you you
D :  A limited that's why i say i don't i don't see the market niche for this if we if we if we are going to have a product that work for d. v. d.s v. c. r.s in everything then i can see the market niche but we were all the identify it is going for television flip out teletext
D :  As like ball we had in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive
B :  Well years
D :  Like this thing marketable because there was just a television remote i don't
B :  Well here's my thing about that
B :  If you're in the market for this alternate remote
B :  You're not gonna go for just a television remote
B :  If it can control if it can control your your d. v. d. player and not all if you if you can't get that all in one alternate remote that just
D :  That's right
B :  You control your other remotes oh wait
B :  I'm not gonna buy that seventy five euro remote
D :  I i i have a tendency to agree with you i really do
D :  I say i class
D :  Question the marketability of the product they're really question
B :  So i think
D :  Create a demand
A :  We're looking for something basic be the one thing that that that you said really struck require a three year and that we're
B :  That's what i'm saying
A :  Kind of course i didn't feel of the product or actual looking for a large profit the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to a problem i would say
A :  We let's just cut down a profit expected on this product because we are actually branding or
A :  Companies here we're selling more than just the product
A :  We're trying to get main share but
A :  Uh real reaction
A :  Two two people who are gonna buy consumer electronics
A :  We want people to eventually see all that's that's real reaction that's a good make
A :  It's reliable
A :  And and we're gonna make you would wanna when men share by
A :  Is it either being a fantastic
A :  Or for walking it just being good
A :  Reasonable price
A :  And solid so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself
A :  And extremely
B :  I think that's a big
D :  Okay so if you if you drop the cost know if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost k. i. when you make it
D :  Less expensive than all the sudden now we're going into an a a new market area
D :  So we can say low-cost uh um
C :  Good design
D :  Uh good design beautiful what the data that ah but what i'm saying is right now we're middle market
A :  It's twenty five euros i made market price for a remote
D :  Yeah for a formality for multi-function remote that's a mid market price in a discount right now you can buy "'em" on sale sometimes for about about the
D :  A team nineteen euro and that's for the multi functions
D :  Uh d. v. d. v. c. r. uh cats shots
D :  And and they have an a little box in the middle and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls so to me to market this at all a a television remote control we have to change can i just as we have to have something that would change people's thinking to identify this is advantageous and i don't know what that is it's gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features
A :  Well i'd be inclined to see if we can
A :  Makes the design better than any compare will remote
A :  For would use in the cost then that's that we we really should play it
A :  We can take it down to
A :  Yeah fifteen rather than twenty five and make a little profit margin right
A :  But we're really doing that to sell the brunt
A :  Five minutes left
A :  Uh rather that it to to to sell for real reactions attacking to make it just it
A :  To the more senior
A :  Uh people within the company
A :  Here to to get a reaction
B :  What about um the idea that i had with a cradle
B :  And if you about that
B :  I had a seven
A :  Well as everybody so that
D :  I i i i would were talking about the other and now i like it and
B :  Thing uh uh
D :  To find out
B :  To see really the other end
A :  The uh the the got the problem was that and my name's i just think off and as a as a consumer but i wanna buy that
A :  And i think maybe not because
A :  I've got remote and i'll take it it doesn't share as well take it to definite oh i don't wanna gold or some wouldn't put it down
A :  It's gonna be somewhere
A :  But you put it there and then it needs to be at the state of your armchair that plays it is only one t. v. user so it's very good for
A :  Some people but
A :  I i like it
B :  It would last for several hours and it's on power but when you're done with it you put it back and okay
A :  It takes a bit ease of use of the remote to send
B :  Yeah well uh
A :  You have to that is a remember you have to do stuff down the side of it takes to find and put it back in
A :  Yeah
A :  They did i think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that one really want
A :  It because of that fact
A :  I don't know that's just my opinion
D :  Well i i think again it's did we have a cost issue here
D :  You know if we're gonna go in this direction to me we're going to the other side of the cost right are we gonna make this selling selling the cost
D :  As a high high-tech uh um
D :  Environmentally sensitive whatever are we gonna go to the lower side of the range
D :  Uh
D :  Again i don't see a market niche in the middle for our product yet
D :  I don't see it yet
A :  So what do we think maybe we should
A :  Okay do you have any
A :  Thing
C :  Uh we should keep it simple um medium well
C :  Cost more um cost area and uh
C :  We can look at
D :  What are question i have in in there "'cause" i i i think i agree with you on the gotta make it a box the boxes gonna sell it i think the outside casing can can can we have multiple designs
A :  Really need to wrap
D :  Have a modern have the traditional have a you know and so so still of the wall looking the same people could have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from
D :  I don't know what that creates cost or
B :  Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of uh
D :  That one over another
B :  For design
D :  Yeah okay
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So
C :  Yeah we get to that
B :  Um but what we could do it some kind of
B :  Well i mean
B :  Yeah we we need to i mean have a few designs to look at and then come up with something
B :  I think we all agree it is you know the best fit i think what's really important is it has to look good it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand it has to be durable
B :  It has to it and i think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap
B :  I think
B :  I think
B :  We have to make sure that people look at it and and feel like it it's like
B :  Oh quality remote
D :  What
B :  Even though the cost maybe
D :  What about a
D :  Remote to it it's it doesn't maybe look like remote
D :  Just an idea just just okay "'cause" i mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside of selling these things everywhere maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity if we make a remote that doesn't even look like remote it it opens like a telephone
B :  What if it looks like a pen
D :  Doesn't matter yeah then to start talking about some something to make this thing you make it that's the thing i'm gonna keep thought but not all sell whatever you guys design and i have a problem selling a product it's not the issue i give the ideas you guys create a product once you have a finished product i'll find a way to sell
B :  A pointer
D :  Don't worry about it i just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings
B :  So
B :  Just to touch and my point one last time that i had brought up
B :  Um
B :  I really um unless you guys i'd die hard against the fact that um is possible like it reduces the usability the remote bit in the fact that you can't lose it and you're of
B :  I think it's still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle
C :  Okay yeah
B :  Because i really think
B :  In a certain sense it almost like for me i would wanna have a just because i know at the end of one um done watching t. v.
B :  When i'm done all i do find the remote and put it back where bonds maybe for the that that's just some people that like that
A :  So all those also remote controls i remember that that worked
A :  Uh this hasn't been done in a while i think that as a as a watch
B :  As a watch
A :  Yeah there's remote control watches um but it i think there are sorry eighties thing so it may not be easy to market and uh
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh but the the thing about this came along it may be cheaper to make many of those things might be expensive for all i know
D :  One thing i just thought about when you're saying that
D :  Is it
D :  But our target market is gonna be someone who has lost for broken
B :  Uh-huh
D :  There's that was lost or broken their their remote
B :  That's what i was
D :  So how many remotes that they wanna buy can we can we sell them of remote they can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one
D :  And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something to to think about
D :  How have people than than losing are breaking a remote how does this happen
B :  Exactly
A :  The last remote you ever buy
B :  And also presumably that
D :  And and then and then design the product maybe some kampala of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need it
A :  Well i've ever going down that then we can we don't need to go to it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be
A :  That quite expensive
A :  To make clear is actually just putting in a power cable
A :  May not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phone genius
A :  We we have
A :  We have actually similar products that we can take from them potentially cut costs that
B :  The locator
A :  Um need to look into whether we can do that but
A :  Uh i think we we have some mobile phone based products uh checking quickly or
A :  Internet would really need to finish up here
D :  We have to
A :  At uh
D :  We could make it in the shape of a coffee pot
A :  Yeah we have a bit parrot that does products we sell power about the product so for example
A :  There's nothing stopping is
D :  I think is telling us to stop the meeting
A :  Using that technology yeah
D :  So we have a cat would probably have have on line in our in our system we have the ability to create is talking about
A :  Yeah i think so without it being to it in fact we can cut costs are using the manufacturing is already gonna be in place yeah
D :  Charging system
D :  If if we can create is we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics
B :  Uh-huh
B :  I think one of the things that we can put write on the boxes never buy another battery
B :  You know something like that
