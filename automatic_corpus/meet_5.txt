B :  Well that's yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  It's recorded okay
A :  Okay so welcome everyone
A :  So where you have for the kick-off meeting
A :  Of uh the process of designing a new remote control
A :  So
A :  I would first up where is the one where come up and
A :  Stuff
A :  And uh
A :  We will us see what will be uh or project and what will be the difference that
A :  We will have to design it
A :  And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few eighties
A :  And we we'll uh and uh
A :  By your are dispatching the different task you will be you would have to for a few
A :  To complete this process

A :  You have another things and
B :  Yeah
A :  So you have to be quick
B :  Yeah for the lot more project
A :  Okay
A :  So
A :  The the bodies to have other remote controls so twelve and at that age oh are are completely does we have to be original
A :  Have to be trendy
A :  And we have to also tried to be user-friendly
A :  So uh the the designs that will be divide it into the uh main points
A :  First it would be the functional design
A :  Third is the conceptual design
A :  And then use the d. day design
A :  So the version i design used to it down to five
A :  The the menus and use
A :  The taking of function and the remote control or fruit for a few
A :  And then we we move to consider design well we specify the different components involved
A :  What kind of designed to have interface we want
A :  And what are the different
A :  The trendy and user interface and stuff like that
A :  And then the the day do that design we've got fifteen uh specifically
A :  Implement seen
A :  And it saying the choice we've uh made in the second point
A :  So i will know ask you which is very important
A :  For the design of the new remote control
A :  Far too uh
A :  Each of us to to draw uh you're for it anymore on the weight well
B :  What the more than an idea
A :  You have any idea of
A :  Which an email you want to show us

B :  Uh-huh
A :  You should
B :  It'll have the same thing
D :  Mm
B :  No
A :  If you want to react uh huh
A :  Well this would go for drawing the uh
A :  I'll it's you uh a comment
B :  To not start going on
A :  Okay it's an abstract doing
A :  I think it's nice and original
C :  You sure i know the name i think

B :  Looks like a bond
B :  Okay so
C :  Quite square in
A :  Hmm
C :  He also i
A :  Mm place yeah
A :  No no it it looks more like you don't feed back
A :  I would say
B :  I think we were
A :  Okay so
B :  We've is uh
A :  I all that it's it's you uh in the process of these a new remote control
B :  For the
B :  For putting uh for a logo know
A :  Okay
A :  Let's one
A :  So
A :  Ja the uh
A :  Finish at a big deal of all project
A :  It is to set to to have the production cost lower then
A :  Twelve point five euros
A :  And i have a selling price of twice that price
A :  In about two target group of that profit off
A :  Uh fifty uh million euros
B :  Is there a market for a new remote control
A :  Yeah if it's trendy already than uh than
A :  Fulfil the user these
B :  The casing the device remote control is it and you to decide to come
A :  We have to discuss that point on
B :  I was not define the top
A :  Yeah you you can suggest points ladies so
B :  Okay
A :  What what
A :  So we have to decide for a somebody's
A :  You can control or one device comment about uh
A :  So what's what are your ideas the one that's
A :  Maybe i can have to your opinion on from the marketing side
B :  What do we still other stuff
B :  Of before but on the remote control something uh to save them
B :  It could be a single device otherwise
B :  The program while a school buy a remote control from us
A :  Okay so
A :  If you'd say that by you'd only you'd you'd rather be from it a pretty nice
B :  Yeah
A :  Do you agree
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah so
A :  Maybe
A :  It should be for multiple devices
A :  And the the you have any i. d.s and off
A :  Uh design i. d.s are in the uh
A :  Uh taking care requirements we we should uh for a few
C :  I think we shouldn't have too many
C :  For my well i think
B :  Uh but now i can five thing in front of requirements right now
C :  If you don't have so many buttons
C :  Be nice
A :  Few buttons so okay
A :  And do you have it or so to be
A :  To be like you know to be used in the dark
A :  Maybe a good idea
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay and you have any um
A :  Any uh heidi off
A :  The train the the trend in the door main what it should it should look like uh things like that
C :  Something which is not it's square we maybe
C :  Uh
A :  Was well
C :  Not a box
A :  Okay
A :  Like for okay
B :  Something that that it fits in your hand
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah
B :  The basic requirement
A :  So
A :  Fits in your hand yeah
B :  You back
A :  And also test you need maybe
A :  It may be important for the remote control to be uh
A :  To um to resist two would buy it shocks that can happen
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Well the proof
A :  If it's four
A :  What a professor there
C :  And i think
A :  Maybe it is a region and because you can uh use eating you are
C :  A device
A :  Menu button
A :  Whereas the of those counts
A :  Maybe what the proof would be very region either
C :  Sorry
A :  Have it as we know what type of remote control
A :  So that the people can uh use it in there but
B :  Mm
A :  That could be uh
B :  It seems or so but uh
B :  If you don't have a know but from what we'll do that kind of school would put some plastic
B :  And you got a bit
A :  Yeah that's
A :  It is to something uh
A :  You have to buy and that's as a
B :  And and that's for the for the shock i mean there are two pull out
A :  Be very
B :  How the remote control and that worries that is going to break and it's um it's uh plastic around it
A :  Yeah maybe
B :  Not a war they actually
B :  The ten cents
A :  But maybe we can but it was a already do use plastic thing
A :  And uh they're what type of uh stuff as well
C :  Directly
B :  It to look at blocking the case
A :  Yeah
A :  Maybe we can say or or that to get there so
A :  So plastic protection and
A :  And uh
A :  And the weather proof box as well
A :  That may be good uh track two four oh
B :  Like as an optional think
A :  Option that are cetera
C :  I that i think we should have something
C :  Most of the time i i lose my remote control
C :  We should have a a special button button on the t. v.
A :  Maybe we can uh
C :  To make the remote control be
A :  But we don't designed it see
A :  Maybe we can have a something new we say or
A :  And the the remote controlled uh beep
C :  Yeah
B :  Barks
A :  Yeah
A :  So we can uh are we said mm uh remote cover
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah we sort
A :  I don't know we we send the uh with forth
C :  We subtraction
A :  We said tracking yeah we said tracking remote control
A :  That's a good idea very region and and that's can uh
B :  That's quite cool but uh of course
B :  Would you don't know what you need there
B :  Any ordeal uh according
B :  Stuff on your remote control right
A :  Yeah they do
B :  It's just one button
B :  The cost
A :  Yeah that's see we have to ooh
A :  We have to have an advantage over our competitors
A :  I think is is a good advantage
B :  Is corn i think i like the idea but i'm not so double to what you
A :  Yeah
A :  Two that's
B :  In our budget
A :  Yeah we have to ask look uh stuff that's the design two d. uh in the she i dunno designer
B :  Yes
A :  Which is you
A :  Okay so try to fade that for the critique
C :  Okay
A :  Okay so next meeting meetings that you mean is total the
A :  So
A :  So i will as the industrial designer to find out more about these industrial design
C :  Uh-huh
A :  So a new working yeah
A :  And you working function we have discussed
A :  So uh then i will ask the user and if i interface designer
A :  To to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons the
A :  The fight it just like to you don knotts things like that and what would be convenient for the user
A :  And
A :  Oh so um we have the uh market expect to uh
A :  Try to find out what are the the absolute requirement with these absolutely need it you know remote control
A :  Uh for the user
A :  So and then that uh uh i will are just a few to think about bats and uh look at sure or maybe because you will receive a some good advice soon
B :  Hmm
A :  So
A :  Thank you i think that's
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Or for this point
B :  Oh i thought about that
B :  Well
A :  It's
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
