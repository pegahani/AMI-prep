A :  Oh it's it's i
D :  Yeah
A :  Fulfil stuff it's
B :  Okay
A :  That's that's
D :  Sure
A :  That's it
B :  Okay well
D :  It kind it is nice as as though "'cause" when we get into the in the meeting what kind of
C :  Mm
D :  Time but action in design as opposed to background everything i was kind of background
B :  Okay
B :  Okay we already did it well i i uh
B :  And in this meeting than
B :  If we uh um
B :  Well just just read half of the minutes from the last meeting
B :  Um we
B :  Uh it decided on
A :  Oh
B :  Decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five
A :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Um we decided that it was gonna be
B :  Non rechargeable battery power that we're gonna creep are audio visual and other functions and so
B :  Into this calories
B :  Um
B :  And i told you guys were the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring of an excel a t. v. and trying to incorporate the
B :  The uh corporate colour and slogan
B :  Um start with the last meeting
B :  Is there anything i've i've run anything
B :  So everything okay
D :  Yeah
B :  And so if we have three presentations and then if if you have anything to
B :  Kind of
B :  But you know you're gonna want to discuss maybe just make a note of that animal have all the discussion at the end i like it better ideas time and so if we start off
D :  Sure
D :  Okay
B :  Uh with
B :  And yeah and then craig in and they have
B :  If that's alright
D :  Sure
B :  And and then after that we'll have to make some decisions
B :  A point
D :  Yeah
B :  Right
B :  So if you wanna
D :  When i get that mm
B :  To us
B :  Scrolling okay
B :  What oh how do you do a speech recognition i really
B :  You sarah that right maybe incorporate women's definite decision on that
B :  Right or should also point out that um
B :  Being a kind of the final object to this meeting
B :  Is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product
D :  Okay
B :  So um
B :  That's kind of the end result hopefully
D :  Okay
D :  Um
D :  Alright so "'cause" it function f. eight
B :  Ah
B :  And and and yeah and
D :  Come on
D :  I think it's working
B :  Oh there we go
D :  Okay okay so
D :  Instead
D :  Okay great
D :  So um
D :  Or is that one
D :  Uh
D :  Oh are the logo is not good
B :  Oh no
D :  Okay i missed
D :  Here
D :  Right i mean
D :  This one okay
D :  And it's still the the template for that okay
B :  Oh
D :  Alright so so look it okay so this is the method that um okay can i had basically wanna wanna do here we get in there too far as i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful
B :  Okay
B :  Okay
D :  And uh and then sort of go through some of the way that uh that was that information and then sort of
D :  Bring is all together and at the c. ceds yeah that's it some of the overall vision
D :  Um so i tried to take a lot of market
D :  Research and summarise it for us and then i'd identify yeah trends that are are sort of in synch an important to our
D :  I were um
D :  Project plan that we have so far
D :  And then that initiate a kind of discussion on design options
D :  So that it's it helps us to to narrow way on on aspect sell inform other um that elements of the of the project
D :  That makes sense that that's strange i thought that that will impact on the rest what we do so that's why suggested we get in
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Um for a pointer right
D :  Okay so out of um different uh figures in ratings above have people in general um consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that
D :  Uh the important to television remote control a fancy look-and-feel okay and not can specify not a functional look or or feel
B :  Okay
D :  Up fancy
D :  Um however this is where we can have to be very adding creative about a number two with that it be innovative
D :  Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative with a adding just a necessary
D :  Um
D :  To the functional bits to it
D :  Uh and third very
D :  Uh for ease of use so again that kind of
D :  Gives us a general picture of how it has to be
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Um and quite user-friendly you will still having technology so that all the same right away is a bit of a foreshadowing how we perceive at us in terms of marketing
D :  Is that i think um what we should think about is how
D :  The um
D :  But how the innovation
D :  Uh it can truly so the look and feel and not so much to
D :  The functionality of it
D :  For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all light up or something you know to me like or it's got something else to add they just scenes innovative because obviously the thing at the messages easy to use
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh
D :  So how do you make innovation makes them or more
D :  Easy to use well that's i guess we're we're gonna go with that
B :  Okay
D :  Okay then there's the other aspect of the it back d. v. market um
D :  Research i have here is on fashion style okay which as we've agreed as a prairie
D :  Um top european fashion trends um
D :  That i read about to say this is this
D :  The merging thing in the fruit and vegetables okay especially in clothes and furniture when i first saw that i thought hmmm what do we want to actually try and think about this trend in how we add something to it or we get right in the or we completely steer away from it you need
B :  Okay okay
D :  My my feeling is that we we do want to observe this trend
D :  But we want to think also that the fact that
D :  It's sort of
D :  Has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics
D :  Um "'cause" i think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor
D :  Partly something like a computer
D :  Um
D :  So i think we might wanna be careful about how you how quickly we create like a remote control the shape of an apple or something i think that would be pushing it
A :  Mm
D :  And then in terms of material trends everything's to be soft and spongy and sort of
D :  Might ergonomic or or from a handle which is which also you indicated that last year this was this is not the case
D :  So um probably a lot of a competition on the market will be still in last year's mode so if we try and re capitalise on that i think that'll be in our favour
D :  Um
D :  So this this is the summary of everything um style is number one uh thing in the in the market if we were selling to
D :  Uh innovative design technology is also a master that it seemed to be seen to be uh cutting edge
D :  Um but ease of use has to be insured threat that was like the number three thing
D :  And then at the end there vibrate natural colours
D :  Um
D :  That's the way i interpreted in any way soft is the material shape and function
D :  And so i brought that rid of the bottom to get a sort of a context of discussion mac ipods something which is
B :  Uh-huh
D :  I that's a very high-tech ten gigabytes whatever but when you hold in your hand the signal buttons
D :  You know the macrophone it
B :  Mm that's true
D :  I'm thinking of a mac ipod a sort of last year is because it's very hard and sort of blasting in glossy so i'm thinking of we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod
D :  And word then making it's more of like uh
D :  More like a comfortable type of or more like a
D :  Maybe more vibrant for anything yeah
D :  Um and then so this is what with all that information um what i'm what i'm suggesting in the slide here
D :  Is that we
D :  We take these ideas and as we get in the more and more
D :  Um
D :  I think like sort of
D :  Production side of things are we think about shape
D :  Materials
D :  And teens or series to go through a sort of like uh
D :  I don't know like um
D :  We think is some kind of a thing thing that unifies at all do we agree on us um like a marketing identity
D :  Um
D :  That makes sense yeah
D :  So
D :  So like a threat a few ideas they're just a kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon line i dunno green colours or whatever just
D :  I. d. x. and thinking that
D :  Some of these ideas for seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people so see that them as in terms of texture shape
D :  Colours things like that
B :  Okay
B :  Correct
D :  Like count the ones the ones that um most fond of in terms of getting like it into it would be like
D :  Um
D :  Lemon or something like that you know something which is
D :  Like you see a lot in in other areas like i see what's web sites and things it seemed associate like lemon and mine
B :  Okay
D :  So and it's just an idea
B :  Yeah
D :  I'm thinking we we could incorporate some these features in a fairly um
D :  In the something which is which seems to have something to which is almost gimmicky
D :  Because like um like something to do it like the lighting within that
D :  Like you know just as in the simple sense when you pick up the phone and touch a button
B :  Um mm
D :  It to uh lights up
D :  Usually the buttons light out how to me build on that maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or
D :  And people could by the by the control and then it comes at different like
D :  Cover or something so
B :  Okay
D :  Any does it that's all i have but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas
B :  That's great
B :  Uh huh
D :  When we get into
B :  Okay great
D :  Hmm
B :  And
B :  Thank you for that
B :  Uh
B :  Create to you and uh
B :  Uh
B :  Like years and uh
A :  Um
C :  The working
B :  Mm
B :  Oh right
D :  You deprive okay
A :  That's probably not sending
A :  Yeah
B :  Some common uh yeah
A :  It is
B :  Uh
C :  And so that was concept
C :  Um to be sure sure and um hanukkah need to it yeah and maybe with my examples of them been existing remote controls
C :  Um
C :  There's a beep or a a discussion about that existing ones there and as you can they
C :  And she getting from them to incorporate them into this
C :  Um
C :  And then this one brands distant on size and say the control and the buttons um the shape of the control and it's rubber the buttons should be location on the control
B :  Mm
C :  Um i'm finding the research is that most controls are just this big breaks with with the buttons all of them
C :  Um you know backtrack to look at
C :  Uh not very comfortable to hold that i just wanted it breaks and the very it is lost and then give a dark colours of the show replace it and say the cages you can we see them
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Um
C :  The
C :  Is it wasn't cells tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme um
C :  For instance the standby button is no threat that we should be something the user then uh identify with this year that switch off that's why should be
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And how much as as any other examples of that button
C :  And for that for
C :  Um
C :  It's from now i have to have a couple preferences finally
C :  Yeah control
C :  Um again within the back of a button stand-by and the other examples of that
C :  Um
C :  The buttons should be large shouldn't be a little things like the uh the mobile phones it should be
C :  Easy to press a comfortable
C :  Um
C :  One examples given on the homepage was um
C :  Is it up and down volume button that was somehow be on them so with the up volume buttons they should be down volume button that can be confusing
B :  Uh-huh
C :  And she avoids things like that
C :  Um
C :  Yes the the corporate customers that we should have a very bright colour so they can be so identified anywhere
B :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  Have to come by the by being packet they're cute and time very easily with your your lemon lemon idea
D :  Yeah okay
D :  Do we have a corporate colour scheme i dunno
B :  I think it's yeah it because like the website the other and it's a bad at the bottom yeah so
D :  Okay
A :  And the plato's yellow
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah they are lemon you know
C :  One plastic
B :  Definitely if if at whatever catering and we'll discuss it
D :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  An extra features we add the on the b. c. one should be didn't we shouldn't be on the
C :  And should be visible without something be opened doors and just before i ever
B :  Mm
C :  Um
C :  If we do you say to go for voice activation uh this short be a bunch of data possibly and they view the top section
A :  But
C :  And make use of them from there are some do voice a bit of a cold or
A :  Mm
C :  Um
C :  We should definite boards the big square block i just brought
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay
C :  And um
C :  We've got an email uh uh from things to do research department and they said the voice control um can i talk back if you have a question
B :  Mm
C :  So if you could be good to have them and confirm a action you tick
B :  Uh that's good yeah
C :  And after a possibility
C :  Yeah the problems about that um
C :  Then with this two weeks ago are we want slogan is something that um fashion into electronics
B :  Yeah
C :  And we don't have like photos kids
C :  I mean do you want that they the corporate colours but they don't say you know for can use any other "'cause" at all
B :  Okay
C :  That's it
B :  Okay
D :  Right
D :  Lots of good information that
B :  Yeah that that was
A :  Mm
B :  Very good and uh know that it's
A :  And she
A :  Um
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Yep cool
D :  It's a shame the cable wasn't just the middle of the table huh
B :  And there are three hundred no
C :  Uh-huh
D :  This stuff
A :  Mm
A :  Oops
B :  Judge on it's a little the line a set of s. n. mm
A :  Yeah okay i mean just get this
B :  Yeah
A :  We are just
A :  Ah it's
C :  But
A :  If
B :  So
D :  It's a second
A :  It should be
A :  Okay um i guess
A :  The same thing again i start with something very basic
A :  So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And then you can just walk through it and we'll have a modified or or from scratch um that anyway you need to
A :  Um the components are exactly the same
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um i think like when you guys said um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface
A :  The rest of the components um did you have an impact in terms of cost
A :  And complexity um like you said time to market was a problem
A :  Um and how me components are physically in in cost and the parts basically a factor of that
A :  Um and
A :  The law components the power the logic which has been an infrared um
A :  The effect in terms of the size of the device
A :  Um and that would have something to impact on how i think more how you hold rather than
A :  Um the actual use using the the remote control because
A :  Um like we say we define i really wanna basic things it to be visible on our estimate right
A :  So um you know it's just a matter of working out space so i guess three things um
A :  Cost
A :  Um complexity and the size is the three things that um we'll have an impact on you
A :  So just go through the components
A :  Um these other options are available to you um i'm not very sure about the voice thing "'cause" i don't know the email and it was fact quite sketchy on what the voice options are
A :  I'm it said it could talk to you but i never said anything about be able to this and it it said something about sensor banana curve like that
D :  Hmm
B :  Hmm
A :  So maybe if you know i could see the other you know we sent to
A :  Um "'cause" you go back to be fine different requirements
A :  Um or at different offerings or what component of a oh okay so your basic components of buttons
B :  Mm
A :  Okay and you have are we all available like um a scroll wheel
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay there's an l. c. d. display
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um i think these are quite standard things
D :  They're standard uh huh
A :  No um there
A :  Well in a sense of these all options available for yeah it's going to the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks it can actually be flat or it can be curved
A :  Um and then the different hats material so you can use um i don't think you can use them in a combination
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um but um i could check that
A :  For you but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination
B :  But you could have like plastic and rubber
A :  Um i think plastic or rubber would be fine but plastic with rubber and what i was i i'm not very sure but the titanium
B :  Uh
A :  They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium
B :  Okay
A :  Um the rubber was a restriction on
A :  The kind of power source you could use but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the
B :  Okay
A :  Things so i think that there is some restrictions on um
A :  I think you could probably go plastic or rubber together
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Wood and titanium but
A :  You might be easier from a cost perspective in a complexity just use one
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  You know supposed to to
A :  Um any uh the components are logic chips
A :  Um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips
A :  The cop how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit
A :  Um and that impacts cost
A :  Um i don't in the logic chip has a sure but size "'cause" they should be about the same size power consumption should be about the same
A :  Um i think the main impact is complexity
A :  Um
A :  And the other thing is um the power options
A :  Um the first one is standard battery
A :  Okay the second one i think it's more of a gimmick
A :  Then actually usable thing it's a wind-up mac
B :  Right here one is theta two
A :  Yeah no uh crank
B :  Display meeting yeah yeah
A :  Yeah but that that might be something
A :  I think that's more of a look and feel position because i don't think you can have one power source if you using alternative power sources
A :  I think whatever it is used to need a battery "'cause" i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing
D :  No
C :  Uh huh
A :  Okay the other ones are a solar powered sell
A :  Which may not be a great idea in europe or it any country that seasons "'cause" of the year you be dead
A :  So like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else um
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
A :  And the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their
B :  Hmm
A :  And it's a nice sales gimmick i think from marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing it's a shake it doesn't work shake it nokia or something you know
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
A :  You know you have yeah those balls you know those stress ball so you buy outs the ball
B :  Oh yeah yes yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  And it a light up and it goes you know that might be a gimmick combine with rubber
D :  Mm hmm hmm
A :  You know it just if you get frustrated a remote control you can throw it kind of
B :  Mm
C :  Huh
A :  You know just the
B :  I know yeah
A :  You know um
A :  So
A :  Um
A :  Okay mike
A :  From my role i don't in a personal preferences my role preferences i think
A :  Um something comfortable to hold
A :  Um small and so am i guess that's
A :  One a sense of small so in terms of comfortable not
A :  Source more you can't you know like a phone or some too small for
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um and getting it from production point of view um
A :  The last components we use in the simpler the components means you pretty sure cost any increase your profit
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  And also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and depending it um so
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Um okay then you just go back and
A :  Talk about some of the restrictions
A :  Um
A :  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons the standard okay
A :  The l. c. you can on the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic
B :  Mm
A :  Um the case
A :  Okay a with a rubber case
A :  You can't have the solar panels
A :  Okay with the taking in case and you check that
A :  Um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  I think a sky because it has to be square
B :  Okay
A :  Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic and
D :  It can't be curved
A :  You can't be curved on the wood so that's again i don't think you can use them in a combination
D :  Okay
B :  Okay
A :  Um especially the titanium i i suspect there are very fixed a particular need
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So um at and mixing them may not be a good idea
B :  Okay
A :  Um yeah that's it
B :  Right
D :  Uh the question um
D :  Can i ask questions
B :  Yeah oh yeah it's just been quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've yeah so but yeah i i ask right
D :  Okay
D :  Can we uh power a light in this
D :  Can we get a strong a battery power like
A :  Um i think we could because the l. c. d. panel requires an hour and the l. c. d. is a form of light
D :  Okay
B :  Mm
A :  So that
D :  To be one of the things we just ran include is a really good battery
B :  Why what kind of like you want anything here
D :  Well
D :  I mean i'm thinking it might be
D :  That for a this to be high-tech think it's gonna have to have something
B :  Yeah
D :  High-tech about it and it's gonna take battery power
B :  Yeah
D :  And to make that
D :  To make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is
A :  I guess thinking are you thinking of of uh like in the sense of um
D :  Can the battery power
A :  A light light or a light in the sense of it those kind of you know frankenstein it's a lot if
D :  Eliminate it items
D :  Yeah close
D :  Well i'm thinking along the lines of year you in the dark watching a d. v. d. and you and you find the thing in the dark can you go like the s. and r.s their be there's always the volume button in a duck
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  And uh you just touch it or you just pick it up a light up or something
B :  Like a phone
A :  Okay
D :  Like a phone yeah yeah
B :  Yeah like the back button for that okay cool
D :  Whereas with phones people charge them once a week
B :  Yeah
D :  We're gonna need to put in a really good battery city will have to charge
D :  There
D :  Remote control if if you yeah
A :  Um that's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch uh can i might watch
D :  There are people than wanna shake the movie control
A :  Um it's probably sends a rough when you fill it
D :  Right
A :  So you could figure that to like like i said about single thing or you could trigger that to use that the power a light as opposed to so when they pick it up right and then that that sort of triggers that
D :  Sure
B :  Hmm
B :  Okay
D :  Okay
D :  Right
B :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Right
A :  Going this
B :  Okay
D :  Okay
B :  Um well that's just go right back to the marketing ideas for start discussing i'd i'd be on that i recall about fifty minutes to play with that most
D :  Okay
B :  So um yeah so you just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach a nasty decision on the the the concepts of the product
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh okay
B :  So back to your idea but um
B :  Incorporating idea of like fruit and uh h. and the corporate colour and things like that
D :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  I mean what's i really think about it
A :  Mm
B :  Does anybody have any ideas of what how we can fiddle that in together
B :  Yeah that's kind of the user interface type of thing where your thoughts on that
C :  Um i could go for a them
C :  You know up a fruit shape the uh very deep sort of curvy type shape than you can see that action colours or three
B :  So maybe do it or we think it's something that looks could sit in your hand have to be are
B :  So you call on the comfortably or
C :  Um also used to see how that would be sort of silver in your hand
B :  So something quite curvy okay
B :  Um
B :  Right okay it colourwise i mean here it is a year i can really made a point about how if you the nice bright colour yellow these it is that
A :  Thank you need that
D :  Was that
B :  Yeah but how if you have a bright colour yellow lose it so much
D :  Yeah
B :  Um and it when the corporate colour is yellow mean if we could think of like
B :  About the colour of the whole problem being yellow i don't know
D :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  And then obviously the uh
B :  The materials
B :  But it has anybody got like an overall picture in mind about what what my work
D :  Well i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something we can it unifies a lot of the different concepts and if we think that what we are what are number one
B :  That's cool
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Marketing motive
D :  Is um the look and feel so for the look-and-feel seem coherent and not just sort of bits and the two pieces of
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Of concept in technology or
D :  Whatever or fashion then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all
D :  So you can visualise
D :  Um
D :  Maybe what we could do is
D :  Think about a concept which touches
D :  Back to the
D :  On the um
D :  The colour use the company colour yellow mean if we think or something like i was saying also line lemon you know we can we come up with something read we tried associate with
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
D :  With like the series we just come up with something like
D :  And we kind of use it as a thing to inspire there
B :  Okay
D :  Shapes something
B :  Right
A :  Is there a particular shape
A :  That you're interested in like
A :  Miss marketing of any research on
A :  So need to be long as in you
D :  Mm
B :  Are you know like in circular and she were
A :  With a square thing well
A :  Yeah "'cause" that wouldn't help narrow down the choice of
D :  Yeah
B :  Which was material yeah
B :  "'cause" i i i was kinda thinking about is well you know how you get this whole system mobile phones and the plastic but then also the rubber on the outside it kinda feels feels kind of former to touch those bit more comfortable maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
A :  Thinking fruits in my head but as tacky
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  And the on and then we could have curved shapes "'cause"
B :  Wood or titanium yeah it's gonna have to be
B :  Boxy in rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know
B :  So um
B :  Well i'm into it want it in like the shape of alignment or or
D :  No no no
B :  No i agree with the either
D :  No no it's more more just that we
D :  We think about like
D :  What it is are trying to it she used and then we have one
D :  One sort of seen that we stick with you
B :  Okay
B :  Right well um
B :  So thoughts about the actual shape of the thing
C :  Mm collects are forced to one take it
B :  This new one too
C :  Um so so what is this your hands and then you can be another bob the top for just a a function need
B :  Uh huh
B :  It's quite distinct a ship that you can
D :  Right
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  So yes we do that
D :  Um we can we yeah like two and what
D :  Like yeah the
B :  Try to draw it on the board
D :  Can you like yeah just being design
C :  Some of that um you got
C :  Two groups there are um
C :  Maybe you could just for opening a circuit can say it to uh
D :  Okay
B :  Ooh that be good
C :  You have
C :  One controls but they are
D :  Okay
B :  Uh-huh
B :  So call that the snowman shape
B :  Trademark
B :  Yeah that's cool um and i mean colourwise that's everything i mean it's quite important to get yellow in there somewhere going to want the whole thing yellow in that yellow and white john something
D :  Hmm
C :  It can be quite nice if you start them this print your uh this or black and yellow and then have to have a next full colour for the buttons
B :  Uh huh
B :  Okay cool
B :  And and also i mean how we're going to incorporate the slogan and the fact that talks j. i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it says
B :  Or is it putting fashion into electronics or something i dunno
B :  Are we need uh if you turn off or something if we can speak if you can actually say the slogan uh might be a bit more powerful than just having a red not somewhere
A :  Uh-huh
C :  I would scare me
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And uh and it's also not at all
C :  I think that would be scared me turn on your control is this this
A :  Mm
B :  And there
B :  Um
B :  And i think and i i mean if you
B :  Also that work if we want to to incorporate um
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And l. c. d.
B :  Supply a where to put that we put that on the inside it or
C :  Um
A :  Do we need an l. c. d. display what
A :  What's the functionality of that
B :  Points to increase the cost of uh a lot
A :  Yeah but the question is what are we using it will work well would be achieved and putting in lights is cheaper putting an l. c. d. panel just make it go with a bit of a
B :  But it's not
D :  What we did a cheap
D :  Well
D :  As well
D :  Uh when you say it's an l. c. d. as in a new uh to be that and that's the thing i can see it happen might be if it was somehow connected with um less things so as you scroll through "'cause" we say we might have a jog dial
B :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  "'cause" you scroll through your stations you can you action tells you what it it's
A :  I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get those things into that so um it's a bit nuts to get you the monday tuesday wednesday you know
D :  Right okay
B :  Mm oh yeah that's true
B :  Yeah
B :  So
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So many for an l. c. d. display
A :  Um i i'm not saying there's no need for an l. c. d. display but um
B :  I think that would make it for a contract
A :  It's what's what what what tell the user "'cause" l. c. d. it tends to be an output as a as a post and input so
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Um
A :  There's a remote control need to top
A :  Back to the user we have the option is because what does it the same thing goes for the speaker is there any of the remote control that
D :  Mm mm
B :  R. i. a. there's really
A :  To talk back
B :  No
B :  Um
A :  Um
B :  I was saying no need for talk back at does anybody disagree with that
A :  Mm
D :  Yeah
A :  You could put it in there
B :  Yeah
A :  I
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Easy
A :  When the t. v. guys you can put the remote control i
B :  Okay
B :  And right so you're gonna have the three different sets of
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Of functionalities um i mean to wanna group them and to
A :  Mm
B :  So have this room and boris them on inside is the ones that what you're thinking
C :  Um
C :  Well i think the advanced ones they're the ones don't use used to be it inside
B :  Okay
C :  And um i think they see "'cause" we had were pretty basic ones that have to call and they are from somewhere
B :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Right
B :  Um
B :  Or else change talk for it
D :  Well
D :  I i was
A :  Where would you physically position the buttons um i think that that has some impact on on and many things
D :  Yeah
C :  Um
A :  Um
A :  Anyone in trouble and uh
B :  So he's gonna um
B :  Hope this in here "'cause" i have a
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Slide about decision making
A :  Yep uh-huh
B :  Which i'm sure
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
B :  Well it's got about five minutes
B :  And and hate us
B :  But you
B :  Um energy what i do think that suggesting where harp are in the think
B :  I would you like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the backup of the battery but have
D :  Sure
B :  Have kinetic power i mean what is anybody think that uh
D :  Then i've had kinetic things before and the the one issue we need keep in mind that then is that
D :  You're committing the user to moving it
D :  And
A :  Like i said we have a
D :  Watches yeah
A :  Hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery
D :  Sure
D :  Oh okay
D :  Right okay
A :  It's just
B :  Okay
D :  Support for i mean just it's just worth pointing it because like
A :  Yeah mm
D :  I've i've known and um people they have kinetic watches that they were all the time and it's just like magic because it's always power there's no battery
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Also known people have
D :  And things like
D :  Like a jewelry watch they were from time to time eventually just it's just too much of a nuisance because i dunno where all the time
B :  Yeah
A :  Yep
D :  Work remote controls similar you were on vacation i don't know every something
B :  Mm
D :  And it's just tested more than so we should
B :  Well i suppose that if you're if you're when you're not using it then you're not using any power either
D :  Think of the
B :  So you'd have the battery as the kind of
B :  To keep it taking aim for idea how many certain after i got quite a bit of those words times i thought
D :  Yeah
B :  And so i think that's what energy is fancy here chip on print it that that's an industrial design thing is that david
A :  Yes yes
B :  Okay it um as for the case kind of discuss that's
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And
D :  This i see right suggest as be small
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of
D :  Like quite small
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah i think yeah
B :  Okay
D :  Um just uh a lot of um
D :  Yeah but we wanna things run into my mind right now i realised are being a fashion to wrap meeting in have but the decisions made
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm
D :  Um but we are leaning quite a bit to decide it being
A :  Mm
D :  Low tech rubber buttons plastic frame is almost like a reproducing the same all the remote control
B :  Okay
D :  That's out there
D :  Should we think about how we are actually getting this hi-tech
A :  Mm
D :  User-friendly right um
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Thing like what is that the where you were using
A :  Uh-huh
D :  To to achieve those goals like
A :  Mm
B :  I think that back lighting the buttons and stuff like that
D :  Okay so
D :  So there fighting that would be good
A :  Or even a clear case um
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  You know uh uh glowing at a growing yellow type case where the yellow show ball but in the dark it sort of
B :  I've got a good idea
D :  Okay
A :  So i
D :  Yeah sure
A :  Um in in a slight said away
B :  So like
D :  Yeah the really good
B :  Cats that you transcribe okay so it's yellow like tended yellow but you can maybe see three desserts i mean
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Or and that might be a light running for like a mouse
D :  Sure
A :  You know you have colours nice and they don't need that much power i said about the battery in that sense really have one or two strategic strategically placed lights
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Sure
A :  That sort of
D :  Yeah they they are many like to
A :  Yeah but because the case is transparent so you
B :  Okay
D :  Okay
A :  Gives it a little bit of a bill
D :  Yeah uh-huh
A :  Doesn't make it freaky
B :  Okay
D :  Um and then the other thing that we worse we've
D :  Can address else achieving its simplicity as i'm thinking maybe you should we try and think about having
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Something like a um
D :  Some kind of an innovative concept about how
D :  The um the volume and the channels or control "'cause" that's the main thing people was wanna do
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Mm
D :  Can we use like a jog dial like a nice a sort of round some more on it where you just roll it or
A :  The question is when you're rolling it how do you wanna rather do you want to roll it like that you want them to roller like that "'cause" in a mouse
A :  Your hands in a position to roll it
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Where's the other thing about having it all about this way it tends to get moved accidentally
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah here holding in your hand you could you could do that can be if you're holding in your hand
D :  Well what we do it like a mouse and
A :  That's a very unnatural motion to yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  Okay
A :  Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot
A :  I'm in mind what for volume
D :  Yeah
A :  And maybe some of brightness controls and stuff like that but not for channels right in here the telewest boxes you got like you don't have to buy all the channels of uh fifty channels imagine kind of uh huh
B :  Mm
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay
B :  Okay
D :  Yeah
A :  Um
D :  Sure
B :  And r.
A :  And i've been having that
A :  You two quick to so okay it's confusing to be i dunno
D :  Hmm
C :  Well the
C :  And for i'm just kidding lot for channels you do have to skip the channel button the time but
B :  Yeah
A :  But users ten the ten want to use that and once you lose out menus expensive like
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay
C :  Rubber
A :  That is that becomes the most accessible
B :  Okay
D :  But that's not a bad thing is that
A :  Thing uh huh
B :  Yes
D :  Because you think about it the alternative is to go
D :  Push the button
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  John the other much easier than
B :  Okay um right well wouldn't it would do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a job down and mark so quickly um i i well for them actually i think they're quite years very quick to to you use
D :  Yeah sure
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design is all that
B :  And the other thing will uh is and we think in any way of getting the slogan it's the same
D :  Yeah like
D :  I mean if we if
D :  If we keep coming back to this board here
B :  Huh
D :  I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea that i imagine that i don't know that it's
D :  But in the shape of the hand it's quite small
B :  Huh oh well okay we've really got a rough up
D :  I don't know
D :  Yeah
B :  So yeah
D :  It's small and that we've got like the the the slogan somewhere like on the casing and the side
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay
B :  Well if we can do that great
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And that
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah okay
D :  Well i mean is not what we just
A :  Mm
D :  So it said we see that had a designer
B :  Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
B :  Um um
D :  And then like a jar
A :  So you wanna expand the shape of uh-huh
D :  And then like a job down somewhere that fits in with the shape of a like
D :  I don't know like here
D :  In with the
A :  That that might have one problem terms of um
D :  Yeah go about this doesn't fit your hand
A :  In terms of whether you're left-handed or your right hand that you might be looking yourself in
D :  Yeah
B :  Hmm
D :  Or maybe just fill it in like down the middle here
C :  Mm
A :  Can i just uh-huh
B :  Okay
A :  Okay just jump in and suggest something quickly
D :  Yeah sure yeah
B :  Well i'm gonna have to really gonna have to hurry on here "'cause" we're we're actually over time
D :  Yeah
D :  It's kind of
B :  Um is there anything anybody's i'm sure but this very into using this to
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  The next meeting's gonna be thirty minutes as you can see in the screen here what you to be are gonna hopefully beating
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
B :  I knew that the designers are gonna be working with play-doh or not
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So um
A :  Uh-huh
B :  That'll be that'll be good
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
B :  An idea that the minutes at the same as possible and i think it's all you think we haven't discussed that we need to a
A :  Mm
B :  It's a really kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing
A :  Um i think
A :  One thing would be that on that because that's gonna have quite a big impact on
D :  Yeah i think that until you know just have to do that what it was flat and you just spun it's that be great
A :  I think um
A :  Yeah that's was thinking the last slide because then you you don't have to put the hand
D :  Yeah
A :  I mean corporate logo structure for it there's lots of space for it
B :  Okay
B :  That's kind of a design thing you guys can can discuss yeah
A :  Um
A :  Yeah but it's also a marketing a function in
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah and materials we sorta said we do plastic and rubber did make
B :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
A :  You can yeah uh-huh
B :  Yeah
D :  I think maybe we should try and stay away from this the big protruding rubber buttons "'cause" i'm just be so standard
B :  Do is something flash with the case
A :  Mm
D :  Something a bit more flash yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay right
D :  Or maybe have rubber incorporated in the the case as well so that it has and also to plastic i've seen can get really textured you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand
B :  Okay
B :  Kinda creepy
A :  Mm
A :  Uh-huh
A :  If you look for for students
B :  Okay
C :  Uh-huh
D :  They feel kind of like a um
D :  You get pens and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not they're actually just plastic that's textured kind of a little bit like
A :  No like
A :  Yeah yeah mm
A :  Yep yep that i like that yeah uh-huh
B :  Okay i'm gonna have to address the cause six years "'cause" or wherever time so um
B :  That's really good like this have so much to talk about that so um
A :  Mm
B :  Pretty much run out of time to to say so
D :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Well you can ruin
D :  Okay
B :  Design stuff go
A :  Uh mm
B :  Yeah quite tell us actually
A :  You got to choose first i
C :  Huh
A :  Every kidding
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Hmmm key changes like pure power cable i don't think it matters
D :  Mm
A :  I
A :  Mm
A :  Okay i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in what needs to be left
A :  I see
A :  Ah
A :  Mm
A :  Mm
A :  A rough
A :  It's a hassle the oops
A :  I mean i think microphones "'cause" it's too is it take them off
A :  Cool
A :  Uh-huh mm
