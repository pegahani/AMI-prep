A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Hmm
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
B :  It's already
A :  Uh-huh
D :  No not really
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Things differently
B :  I i am
A :  Yes
B :  I'm afraid
A :  Your judgement is is biased
A :  Oh
B :  The remote control is a prototype
D :  It's all uh ways
D :  What control
C :  See
A :  No no no no no
A :  So hmmm
A :  Let's go for our detailed design meeting
A :  So i'll well uh still play the role the cedar trees yeah and it's
A :  We'll have um if there is people just presentation uh-huh
A :  By our
C :  Okay
A :  Yes the interface designer
A :  They did you are then
A :  And our industrial designer about that
B :  Yeah okay
A :  Oh
A :  So we'll have to evaluate the um your
A :  Proposed remote control and so on
A :  Have an idea of the price that's um this
A :  Thing
B :  This thing
A :  I am in case if we're we all agree on me for the kick off a building of these remote control
A :  We'll evaluate c. d. in production uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh so uh-huh
A :  Maybe i will lead to be our two designers talk about so on
C :  A whole slide
A :  There you have stalled sorry it is
C :  Oh
C :  Participant three
B :  If it could be one side and you can
C :  For that part
B :  Discuss everything
D :  But slides
C :  Okay
C :  Okay
C :  This is our
C :  Product or
C :  Prototype
C :  This is made by plane
A :  Looks trendy
C :  Yeah
C :  Are the basic colour is
C :  Oh yellow and red yellow it's
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Our company colour
A :  Uh-huh okay
C :  I read it
C :  Oh in the small
C :  Attractive so
C :  We used to basic colour yellow and red
C :  And this shape there's two basic shape the first is the cycle
C :  And the second in the triangles base
C :  If we call it the martian design
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Looks like so much room so we call it mushroomed design
B :  Yeah
C :  This is the introduction of our products
A :  Uh-huh genetically modify much room i was there but
C :  Nee something
C :  "'kay"
C :  Okay
A :  And speaking
C :  Yeah it's and that's nice
A :  Mm
C :  So that's our key features of our pro prototype
C :  The first thing is that if it's fancy
C :  I'm sure this would be the unique design the market
A :  No
B :  If we a half euro
A :  Maybe i hope so
C :  Yeah so it's a fancy design and the unique design
B :  Yeah
C :  Um
C :  And uh uh
C :  The second key features that uh
C :  So go to channel out
C :  Um so nice and
C :  In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to
A :  Hmm
C :  "'cause" i liked the channel
A :  Mm
C :  Uh now we have well it's not stuck also
C :  We can paint is paul
C :  To select
C :  Channel
A :  Uh-huh
C :  It's quite coming in for user to use it
A :  Yeah get this done touch don't destroy your
C :  Yeah it is
B :  Isn't it
A :  Still i have
C :  Okay
A :  Hmm
C :  Uh the the third stage very that stable at triangle base
C :  Uh in this state that this
C :  Triangle basis of mars table so
C :  Oh
C :  So is is um
C :  It's a likely you cannot find it so
C :  It's uh um
C :  You can put it to the table so we we can
A :  Mm
C :  Turns on the board switching to select the channel
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And that's um cube button you can can you can see that this shape of the buttons and is um
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Mushrooms on that
A :  Everything's much from
C :  Yeah it is much
A :  So we can call our
A :  Remote control that much room
C :  Much of a design
B :  Yeah it's not like in a remote from the you have you know the
B :  Like lemon sure no senator
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay yeah
B :  Is yellow and
C :  Yeah that's why if you put it in the table
A :  Mm
B :  To integrate
C :  You can throw some only that you could
A :  No
B :  That's it
B :  You didn't work
B :  Yeah to integrate the fruit aspect you know there
C :  Yeah
A :  Um mm
D :  Yeah because
B :  "'cause" uh-huh
D :  Mushroom was not in the trends
B :  Right
A :  And vegetables
D :  Fruits it
D :  Yeah
B :  The fruit and veg o. so much more of a cat of you know sure um
A :  That's the whole notion is a vegetable
D :  Uh well thank you use
A :  It's a vegetable
B :  Not sure
D :  Mm hmm
B :  Are are not sure
A :  So i think it's something usable yeah
B :  You can see it's every day kind of into it but you know we we integrate these are the different
D :  Yeah
D :  But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so
D :  That's fine
C :  Shouldn't
B :  I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable by using you know as as you know very enlightened colours yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  No i mean yeah
D :  Yeah inspiration inspiration is
B :  Inspired colour and
A :  Mm
B :  And very sophisticated matter so
B :  And
B :  So
A :  Next slide
C :  Ah no it's are we
B :  So what being at what i can add to use that you know
A :  Uh-huh
B :  What she's done about what he's outside
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So what the inside is agreed is what we talked before about you know as a cheap
A :  Mm
B :  These are all of the shape and
A :  Mm
C :  So we can't see
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
B :  You know you don't need to have to
B :  You know it
B :  I dunno whatever chips inside and you know is there an c. d. but i'm
B :  And it's uh uh
C :  So where's the battery battery
B :  No but it is under breathe
A :  In the base
B :  In the in the end
B :  Ladies yeah
A :  It's the base and where is
A :  That solar cells
D :  You said so uh
A :  Where is the solar cell is
B :  In fact this is this is this is a kind of thing you revolutionary so our receptor that we can put outside and from that
A :  Mm
A :  Or do you think it was me it was christ increase the price
B :  Uh i i i don't think so from that
A :  "'kay" well see i'm sorry
B :  It's might be okay so
A :  We'll have first two uh-huh
B :  It might be okay
A :  So uh-huh use the money what's your opinion according to these
A :  Remote control
D :  Uh i mean
D :  We're gonna try to measure well
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Good e. d.s instead of just talking about
D :  Uh we had three keys
A :  Uh huh
D :  Key points to uh
D :  For this remote control design and
D :  First one was
D :  Uh
D :  Fancy
D :  Look-and-feel
D :  So what we tried to judge
D :  It's it should
D :  Uh with uh one to seven scale
D :  One being and all
D :  I think i've just let me
B :  And
A :  Mm
B :  So four point three point five minutes it acceptable
A :  Uh-huh
D :  One one being true and seven being false
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Mm oh
C :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
D :  A fancy look-and-feel
C :  I think so
D :  According to
A :  Uh-huh
B :  But then you have nice colours
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Is this shape is abortion
C :  Yeah the city's unique and the colour
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Oh i agree it's you need is it really
B :  E. d. t. a. files
C :  Don't know how do you do you define fancy
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah i mean fancy was
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Was defined by use fruit and vegetable
A :  Uh-huh
B :  It's you have the lemon aspect of this but this is this the case
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh yeah maybe if you change if you take the bus and salads
B :  If you don't do that either
A :  Maybe do things like that so
D :  Oh no was a lemon use but
D :  I mean it's not obvious
B :  Did they should use a lemon right so
A :  It would be that and more like a lemon
D :  If
D :  Or maybe improving the text or like having a less
A :  Yeah
B :  Yes but then
D :  Some of all
A :  Mm
C :  They are
A :  Mm
C :  So my mouse
A :  Hmmm looks like more fruit mm
B :  And we don't have any but then uh
A :  Maybe uh pineapple uh-huh
D :  Yeah oh
A :  And you know you have the
A :  Finger uh-huh here
A :  Well the buttons
B :  That's uh yeah that's a
D :  Dating
B :  A good idea that's great
A :  It looks well i hope
B :  That's great
A :  Sorry what's the use for that
B :  I know
C :  Or if you want to obtain the ball
B :  Have no idea
C :  It's very
C :  It's very coming in for you to
C :  Okay in the board to change the channel
D :  Okay
A :  And where is the voice recognition
C :  Well it's in bad it yeah microphone
D :  Yeah that's
C :  That that that's
D :  Wait that that's the second point
C :  Two function is this isn't
D :  As long as we have to just uh
B :  T. v.s finds yeah
D :  Fancy look-and-feel
A :  It is it's
A :  I don't like that
A :  That's a it's a pineapple now
B :  The clock is the colour i suppose
D :  Well the colours okay that's fine
B :  So the shape
D :  I mean they
D :  That would say they're small too much read
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So much right
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Ah
B :  In the basement
A :  Uh-huh it looks like a pineapple we've cherry on top
A :  Ah
B :  Yeah
D :  Right so
D :  From one to seven
B :  Uh you have
A :  Seven isn't that the mexico
D :  No oh seven is false and one is true
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I don't use
B :  Two or three three it's okay
A :  Three i will say three
B :  She is true it's it's fine for
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Is that it that i like that so
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Then uh that's me
B :  But either
D :  Yeah like greta in these
B :  Is it easy to use
D :  Take me load you can be um
A :  Visible
D :  And as you can being innovative
A :  You said previously that she cares um microphone inside and no
C :  Yeah this is mike for re in fact
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
B :  It's a matter of uh
C :  Therefore microphone
A :  Uh-huh okay
C :  So they could be v. d.
A :  And
C :  Ach very
A :  There's the technology inside a quick look nice simple focal comments
C :  See i can share a voice
A :  And you can to it so maybe it's taken out
C :  Yeah so you can have
A :  Logically that as we know that
B :  I think in you know sit there are a round remote control so ideas
D :  Yellow or when you say technology could be small well
B :  Okay
D :  I know in the colour or
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Single
A :  We have tactilely buttons
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Is it you have microphone array i mean how
D :  No that's good yeah
B :  That's good and you have you know these kind of these
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So now receptor of that
A :  Oh yeah
D :  Yeah that's another really good point maybe
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I think technically it's acceptable uh
A :  Maybe two mm
D :  So using the same scary too
B :  Do we have to it's it's fine
A :  What's it to
A :  You agree
C :  Yeah
A :  And special
D :  No maybe the most critical one
B :  False
A :  Okay
D :  That's one what would like to do it is
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Is it easy to use
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Eight floors of luck um one yes it's a might be easy is this meeting
C :  Yes very easy
A :  Mm
B :  Use need
D :  But this this stunning
C :  See this three
D :  Can you can you just explain you know
A :  Uh-huh
B :  He's a percent but
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Please
C :  That this is a base
C :  So you can paint
A :  Mm
C :  To change the channel
A :  Mm
D :  You know how how we treat t. v.s it to turn things to change channels
C :  Okay
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I think maybe if you
D :  Like if you want to
A :  Oh i understand
B :  If you're still
A :  Take the remote so so and you can't uh
C :  Yeah
A :  That's change a channel
D :  Yeah but i imagine you you
A :  I think it's quite easy to do so the zapping
A :  But maybe it will be too fast
B :  Okay
D :  Yeah i'm i'm not i'm not that's really convinced it's
D :  It's the best way to if you want it
D :  John from other one to twenty
B :  How about this
D :  How can you go or direct you to twenty for example
C :  Then uh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  I see it oh it's it's depend on the the angle it in the
A :  Mm right
D :  Yeah
D :  I agree but i mean if
B :  You need to know
C :  They say that and a light
C :  It could it could be
A :  No
B :  I think something that
C :  Channel three channel four channel five
A :  Yeah you have a clicking clicking clicking clicking clicking
C :  To change
D :  Just imagine you have fifty fifty channels that
A :  Uh yeah
C :  Yeah it's it's kind of divided by the number by the by history kinda a certain degree
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So you got
C :  How many degree you
A :  Yeah but you but you have to go through all the channels you
C :  Well you don't
B :  Let's can
C :  You know it's a manual we as well
C :  Take a way to stop the
C :  One
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Then
C :  The angle you stop
C :  A tango you
C :  A channel you
D :  How the hell you know this end of that you to crack on
C :  Sorry they because you know you know how many and channel are there
D :  So you you can't uh no one degree two degrees know
C :  You can do it
D :  I don't think so
B :  Yeah yeah it's a bit do you do that
C :  "'kay"
C :  I think so you could just
B :  I think it but but the the local call it easy easy to you can save
D :  Yeah but look at the money's okay
B :  Fifty it's okay so
D :  Ooh we've said previously that
D :  Maybe it's not going
C :  That that also number
A :  Yeah but when you're zapping it changing from one child to the other so you're passing through all the channels
A :  So when you say i want to go to channel number twenty that's you decided to go to channel twenty so you can say channel twenty
B :  Yeah yeah and that's
A :  What channel four because you really want to go on this channel but if you really want to
D :  This would be more for browsing
A :  To do zapping you you laundry know what you want to you you can turn it
A :  Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there's something interesting
B :  To see uh
B :  Yeah
D :  Hmm
A :  Seems to be good
A :  Good choices today be jordan
B :  Thank you
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh huh huh
D :  Yeah i mean you're famous
B :  And but yeah it
D :  You really
A :  Yeah no idea was
C :  You can do that and it's
A :  Jerry
C :  I can't you can't you can't
B :  Is that a know that on a banana
C :  To a swatch you in
A :  Mm
C :  You you if you want to ski from channel one to channel tool you use keep this
C :  If you want to from uh it's keep from channel one to channel can you can do is
B :  Yeah that's right
D :  Uh-huh
C :  It's like fine from cost of fine
C :  Steve cost if it's fine
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah yeah that's
A :  Oh okay
C :  It's cost to find design
B :  That's a bit intimidated so
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay this expel yeah
C :  Yeah it is it is it from one channel two
B :  And uh i didn't see where is it to turn off to ten and twelve buttons would like it it's maybe one of the
C :  Maybe to ten channels
C :  Is it front line
A :  Yeah but you have the ball call comments
B :  Uh it's to use
C :  Yeah
A :  Oh on off
B :  On off yeah
D :  Yeah but it has to be on to
B :  It would have to
D :  If we could have to
A :  Most the time you have a uh-huh yeah it's a sleeping remote control
B :  Yeah he's sleeping
D :  Uh that's not the ecology car
A :  That's true well that's why we have be
D :  So uh
A :  Solar
B :  A comment says exactly
A :  To get yeah uh-huh
C :  Okay
D :  So which number
A :  So
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Easy to use it's very do that you would three it's fine i think
B :  It sort of them
A :  Do you agree
C :  Yeah i agree i agree
D :  So reasonable useful is one
B :  Three for three four
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
B :  Here's a case of it
D :  So long
A :  Uh-huh
B :  For three
B :  What to see how many everybody use uh huh and this would be good mean
A :  Uh-huh
A :  No what's your opinion
D :  That's a i mean
B :  Four
D :  Does that sort of agree but this one would be more five to me
B :  Five
D :  I'd like i mean this is not just a prototype
D :  I'm not really convinced is
D :  So easy to use
B :  Yeah so
C :  Oh but what do you want um
A :  Uh-huh
C :  You compare with traditional
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Um
C :  Um the traditional control or
A :  Mm
C :  I think it's easier than to do is a comparably to use for these are countries have to put a button
C :  And i don't have to prove button you have you just kinda
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah but you know
C :  The ball
C :  We can all ball the smaller that that uh
D :  Yeah
C :  So you can't you can't you can't contra scale
A :  One
A :  But
C :  In the traditional control how to how to control the scale
D :  Uh by pushing a zero lot uh
B :  You just push
B :  A zero and
D :  The first one
C :  Eight you you can do it but it also the leading the but if you you do not but if you could not
A :  No
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Well the brought in all the channel you can just
A :  Uh-huh
C :  That's also a button here
B :  And that's um but that's okay
C :  Yeah this function is just for all brought them
C :  From one channel two
C :  The next line to make and that's that's the sunlight
D :  Uh-huh
A :  It's not a just a pretty super
D :  Yeah if you changing your mind
A :  It's entertaining this was
A :  He fine
B :  The shower
D :  Fine to course
A :  Fine course and from ten to ten channels like you
C :  One to ten ten to twelve
C :  That into uh thinking
C :  And the t. v. and this and one two three four five six
C :  And it's
A :  Okay
C :  But that's different ski all
C :  So you can
D :  Okay
C :  You can choose
D :  It is
C :  How much
D :  This has to stay on the table right
C :  Uh-huh
D :  This has to stay
D :  On the table
B :  Info on a friday
C :  As you can just
A :  Uh-huh
B :  You can
D :  Yeah but then that when you're done done it
B :  Oh yes yes that's right
A :  Yeah not not that you called
A :  Doubts as just your training from the base unit to have everything in the hand if you want to turn you can't use it and then
A :  You need to put it all
D :  That's the weak point because with the traditional when you just that one menu
A :  Yeah they would be able to take it in the pockets and being used in the kitchen say i've lost remote control
A :  Nobody would take it
B :  That's
D :  Yeah you would
D :  You've we never lose this one yeah
A :  Lose it
C :  So that this is that the next generation come for
B :  And uh
B :  Yeah very good
B :  It's the next prototype mean
C :  Yeah maybe
A :  Maybe we can change from
B :  Four maybe four it's okay
A :  Four
B :  I'll put four
A :  Easy to use for can say four
D :  Four
B :  Yeah for it's more
D :  Oh it's even easier to uh
D :  Maybe
B :  You don't you dare is is it
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
B :  Therefore it's more than once
D :  So i average
B :  No
B :  Nine or
D :  Three
C :  Three
B :  Three
A :  Well
B :  Oh yeah it's abbott is so than
D :  Okay so
B :  It need maybe somewhat for the work but
D :  Yeah especially on their easy to use
B :  Yeah yeah yeah
D :  Right
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So that v. project is
A :  Except that
B :  Yeah
A :  But yeah
A :  I thing that's it well mm
A :  Be good to do some more work true is one piece into pineapple uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Uh-huh
A :  If you were we really want to have a fruitful
A :  Yeah
C :  They get here
A :  So
A :  Mm hmm
B :  Fine and
A :  How can we we had a project to start presentation would be
A :  W. a shot so uh else
A :  We all agree to accept
A :  And the uh_huh certain conditions
A :  The prototype will have a look to um final some financial
A :  Are you
A :  So
A :  We need to
A :  Calculate them production cost
D :  Uh-huh
A :  As i said in the first meeting went to have sought a remote control that would cost more than twelve and
C :  Uh-huh
A :  One fifty euros
A :  And it's not it's if it's not the case you would have to redesign it's
B :  Yeah
A :  So just have a look at the e.
A :  Okay here is to be
A :  X. uh
B :  What
A :  Shit so
A :  So has the energy source
A :  We have hunting um well no we don't use that's
D :  No
A :  We have a battery right
B :  Yeah okay
A :  Kinetic we don't have it so i suppose but we have solar cells
B :  No
B :  Mm it's not so
A :  Um how many do we do you need solar cells to thing one would be an a four
A :  Such as
B :  Uh i think in it
A :  As a number of them just three mm
B :  At three three uh uh through the best thing so so
A :  So uh i like to make sure
A :  Single simple chip on print just one would be necessary
B :  Simple simple yeah
A :  One
A :  Zero for the others
A :  And sample sensor sample speaker
A :  One
B :  Mm one mm
A :  As we have voice recognition i think
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  So the case
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Is it would be one
D :  So we all already nineteen
B :  Wood and
B :  Yes that's it
A :  I heard a
C :  The solar sail it
A :  I'm drawing just an idea
B :  Yes yes the wouldn't uh about the the woods a plastic this one
A :  Yeah but what what would case uncurved flat single curved double curved
A :  I think it's more like double curve
D :  That's gonna be double
B :  Double curve yeah okay
A :  One
B :  One yeah
A :  Um would
B :  But it is
D :  Rather for the
B :  Or or rubber um
D :  Uh no uh interface
A :  Um do when it's special colour
A :  You may be too we have two special colours
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah yeah that's special colour
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Pushbutton
C :  Yeah we have four
B :  Five
C :  Five
A :  Okay
A :  Scroll-wheel wouldn't know
A :  It's more like integrate this
B :  I think it's really like disk
D :  Yeah that's a wee and
B :  You saw it on each on it so
C :  But those
A :  Yeah maybe to scroll wheel and we have the colours
C :  Okay
B :  Yeah true
A :  Course to find a scroll wheel uh-huh
B :  Yeah
A :  So no button supplements
D :  Um
A :  Okay
A :  Okay we i think we have a problem
B :  As c. display in the interface
A :  I think this
A :  If we keep on the adding things
B :  It's okay but that's that's fine
A :  So we have to
D :  Yeah well one of them key point is solar cells
A :  Maybe if
A :  To of suppose if we change and we
A :  It would just one
D :  Hmm
A :  Has it changed
B :  Yeah it was it around
D :  No you you did change but
A :  Okay
C :  We have seen the electronics
D :  Just imagine we have
C :  Two from
C :  From the the sample sensor to
C :  Regular chip
C :  Well
C :  We have to give it to the sample sensor i think
A :  Yeah but you have you really v. voice recognition know
D :  Yeah but this one one of the future we were not
C :  Yeah is the one you made maybe we have we have were in so for for an basic right
A :  Okay
B :  As you can cut some of the wood into plastic may well right i think that this can be
C :  A lot more
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  So it would be better
B :  Yeah wood into plastic and it should be fine
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Plastic is free
D :  Yeah
A :  So do we know special colour
D :  Yeah that's one of
A :  Because we have red
D :  The requirement
B :  Yeah right and you know
A :  Red and yellow
D :  We could do um we could um a missing in either you had all black black then use a regular colour so
C :  Yellow
A :  I think so we need to see if we try to have a kind of
D :  Yeah
A :  Pineapple be
B :  Okay so you have
D :  So push button and then it's it's the next
A :  Yeah and that we have integrated scroll-wheel with push the button i think this is one
D :  So
D :  Yeah this might be
A :  Integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton
A :  So we have we have only one
A :  Um mm
A :  Pushbutton
D :  Close to
A :  So if we have
A :  All integrated in in the scroll-wheel pushbutton
A :  It's uh
B :  The remote maybe
B :  You have five
B :  Pushbuttons so we can do this
A :  Mm
B :  Yeah i'll try to modify some of them
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay so what's that
D :  Oh right
C :  How about teaching yeah
D :  Ah but uh
B :  Double curved we can come from the double curved control of saying that
A :  Something flats
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah but flat
A :  So uncurved
D :  "'kay" is what's
A :  Yeah maybe not
D :  "'kay"
B :  Single curve matter
A :  Yeah
B :  Single curve before
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Well
A :  Mm
C :  Well we have and
D :  And then one euro left
A :  Nearly
D :  Um
A :  I don't know battery or a solar cells
B :  That's about it yes
C :  Yeah
D :  Um mm
A :  I think the problem with the push pushbutton we're needs maybe just one
B :  Well i think
A :  Just
A :  Yeah
C :  Okay
B :  That's true
D :  So we have one button
A :  Yeah you
A :  So one button
A :  And
B :  Yeah it's a scroll with that
A :  Scroll-wheel with push a button on it
B :  And the vocal chords that's fine
B :  It's fine
A :  Uh-huh so
D :  It's good in a charging anything for that
C :  This is
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So we um i think one of them good job as the cost is
C :  Could could be have a look
A :  Twelve fifty
C :  We have a look at the
D :  Yeah yeah it's true it's wrong we're not on the
C :  The
D :  Twelve
C :  The cost
A :  Yeah that's and there are you call this not great and sometimes it's uh i'm very cool
D :  Was enough
B :  It's fine
B :  It's a really quite fine so
D :  Okay
C :  Okay
C :  So let's see
A :  Twelve fifty
C :  Well what
C :  Yeah
B :  It's fine perfect
C :  Which party them all see president part
A :  Or
D :  Solar cells
B :  As far as that's true it is it
A :  Yeah i think
C :  Yeah i think these notes and then
A :  Mm
A :  I think yeah but it would be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of
B :  Yeah to be able to start
A :  Advertisements
A :  And sending these solar cells to be
D :  That's nice argument but
B :  Making it
D :  If it's it's didn't fall a
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Really really uh really very very expensive so
D :  Two of
D :  Yeah
B :  Maybe uh
A :  Yeah but it would be technologically innovate innovative so
D :  Yeah but we just have one button so
A :  Uh-huh
A :  So it's so easy to use and powerful
A :  As the remote control uh and has a new one but uh
D :  Easy at all about
D :  Powerful
B :  It's easy and it's very easy to use the whole thing
A :  Easy but
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So i don't think we need to redesign beep
A :  The product
D :  Oh that's what
A :  Mm
D :  We've just done
B :  He died is easy and other
B :  Because real high and so
D :  Um
A :  So
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Now mm
B :  So what are we going to do this project evaluation
A :  So
D :  Oh i think we have just have to discuss it
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  So did you enjoy you or
A :  Play modelling
C :  Of course
C :  This is my top
A :  Was that a nice way to create a new remote control uh-huh
C :  Yeah
C :  It's a
A :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  To create a conference then of a computer
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah i think i find it very funny an amazing interesting
B :  That was for the process to from the beginning to that and
B :  And design you're looking at the chips as a lot of sense and uh huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  It's a very informative for us
A :  And forty marketing uh-huh
A :  Right
D :  Oh i thought that was good that we should have more brainstorming like
D :  Meetings maybe
D :  "'cause" we just presenting one is presenting is stuff
D :  Next one is stuff and then
D :  We tried to combine afterwards and
B :  Yeah
D :  Oh
A :  And new ideas about new products maybe with
A :  Which would be fashion and um mm
A :  Uh-huh
A :  And yellow
B :  Yeah
B :  I think and seeing what are you able to you know that it it for t. v. or i dunno
B :  It can be interesting yeah

A :  Yes
A :  Really of it

B :  A bit
A :  Yeah but the colour i think colours
B :  As a as a yellow borders saying that
A :  Because i i i i don't think you and everything something like that before for remote control
D :  Steve that was one of the requirements we have
D :  It's yeah but i don't think it's such a problem just putting those somewhere
B :  It you can put some
A :  We decided to have something yellow and red for the costs
D :  Yeah
A :  So yeah maybe we can just integrate on the on one side
D :  Mm
A :  Be double r.
B :  Okay yeah that's a good idea so
D :  Yeah
A :  So we have the logo we have a colour
A :  And we have the fashion in electronics so we have the slogan to it
