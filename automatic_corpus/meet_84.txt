A :  Uh it and just take and
A :  Mm uh-huh
A :  The something for themselves what is best
A :  Okay
A :  Now
A :  Um
A :  We have to get down to the nitty gritty of
A :  How to make this and this remote control has to be sold
A :  Um where to sell it for twenty five euros with a profit aim alternately of fifty million euros that tells you something about how many
A :  Um no we have to sell
A :  On international scale
A :  Um would be an awful lot of these would be like a hundred million of form
A :  Um
A :  To make twenty five euros on each one and spectral profit of fifty million
A :  Um not the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item
A :  You know
A :  If the cost twelve and a half
A :  We're selling it for twenty five you're making twelve and a half euros speech
A :  Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million that's just
A :  You do the math and how many we selling
D :  Um yeah
D :  I was just wondering if that's the um
D :  If fifty percent
D :  Is a normal
A :  Mark up
D :  Yeah and i would think would be more like sixty percent
D :  But um
A :  Okay
D :  I mean they have two thoughts uh-huh so
D :  And in your question is how many do we have to sell
A :  So
A :  Yes "'cause" our market
A :  Um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing
A :  Of you know you gotta know how many
A :  We're going to be selling to know how they can market you have target
D :  Twenty five
A :  And who is that
D :  Yeah that's
D :  Um
A :  To give you pretty good idea where you look at
D :  So it's four million of "'em"
A :  Something like that
A :  Okay
D :  Yeah
A :  That's fifty million euros
A :  Number make fifty million euros and you're only getting twelve and a half
D :  And if we make
D :  Uh-huh
A :  That's a lot of
A :  Selling
A :  Two four
D :  Form mm
A :  To be if if the p. four million
A :  You have to sell four million
A :  Okay
A :  Right
A :  Experience with remote control where is the use of remote control for television or d. v. d. year or something
D :  Yeah
B :  Oh well that's the show the product we're talking about one that will work for the home environment for
A :  You're both in a link all three
A :  Well
B :  T. v.s yeah
A :  I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device that time
A :  But i also for about them not working well or not well to work maybe a new one up working with this one for the the street and then this came over here for another
C :  It is chez that you're always send a in your use a new sofa and you wanna change something that's five different remotes a one for the t. v. they want the video and one for cable and one for
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah that's quite easy missus
A :  They don't always talk to each other
C :  Using this is just for television
A :  Don't know
A :  Okay are there any
A :  Um
A :  Ideas for the remote what would be for war and what
A :  Group would be before
A :  We have to think about that one
D :  We could make a hell okay d.
D :  Themed remote
C :  I think one of the right colours would be good
D :  Yeah
D :  We could totally go for the
B :  I think one that works pretty good
D :  Chip animation well i mean there's also the cachet that um
D :  Uh the japanese make great products
D :  Electrical
D :  The uh industrial design is very good
C :  I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions like i've got one at home
C :  That has
C :  Well uh part of the of these channels channel up channel down volume
D :  Yeah
C :  You know subtitles me
C :  There's a lot of buttons i've got no idea what they did
A :  Ah
D :  Well
C :  Uh-huh
D :  That's a really good point because i think one of the things that
A :  Okay
D :  Being somewhat computer literate
D :  We tend to
D :  Um can the menus and then make choices in itself it's a good uh volume button
D :  You you can go and it's a mute or or volume we don't need to have
D :  Like do the numbers
A :  Uh-huh
D :  If we also have uh
D :  Uh channel up channel down
A :  Hmm
A :  Okay
D :  We can make it smart like an ipod
D :  Uh-huh make everything menus
C :  In closing least
A :  Yeah
A :  Um
C :  That's correct
A :  I know this sounds like it was very quick but
A :  Be
A :  I think that's the industrial design is the first one that's key to
B :  Mm
B :  Uh-huh
A :  For the working design
A :  And user that's use stuff
A :  For the technical functions design
A :  And for marketing the user requirements specification
A :  I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other work through this as a group
A :  And i think we all
A :  You know
A :  We like a kitty cat in a rat in our fish but i think we all have to like each other
A :  Um to get this done
A :  Um as it says we're gonna get individual instructions
A :  But uh i don't think they all out a lot of extra time so i think all little bit of was that the some more it to do
A :  We'll servicing goods that
A :  Do you all agree
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Alright
A :  Um
A :  Then i don't see any reason to prolong it
A :  And for we should finish this meeting that like right now one's going to of the thanks
A :  Alright so this is the end of the first meeting
D :  Okay
A :  Thank you all
