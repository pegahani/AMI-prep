C :  Um
D :  Useful it's it's just
A :  Mm
C :  Just what you see as read um
D :  Uh it's it's
C :  That can be replaceable
A :  Right
C :  Um and then the button
D :  Oh well that's true
C :  You kind of poking through rather than
D :  Oh the buttons would be much longer
C :  No much slider but
D :  Once it's it's slides
C :  A see-through

C :  And then yeah the buttons
D :  Yeah
B :  On off switch
D :  It's
D :  Yeah
D :  Yes
D :  Yes
B :  Even notice on our prototype um they've ended up with occur
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Oh
B :  Sort of thing
D :  So
D :  Yeah
D :  Mm it's it's it's
D :  Is that

D :  Good job yeah it's a really good
C :  Well thank you
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Yes you know it's
A :  Mission criteria
D :  Okay so are pressed
D :  I don't really know exactly what we should uh
D :  Oh no it's under evaluation
D :  Alright
D :  Um
D :  So these are the creek here we're gonna ask is it easy to use it fashionable
D :  Oh i see i just wish like this to switch our first um
C :  Feel good meaning what
D :  You like
D :  Does it feel good like yeah physically
D :  I
D :  That's just for the current trends
D :  It doesn't look at guess
B :  Yeah it's a little difficult to incorporate be cat
D :  So
D :  He or she
B :  You cherry for a day
D :  But it's so we do have a mobile covers right yes yeah all done that
B :  Yes
D :  I think are very have that
D :  Yes
D :  Yeah
D :  Okay so reason that criteria a first points "'kay"
D :  Yeah and it's
D :  So we need to discuss how we feel
D :  It falls within the strange so for easy to use
D :  To filter easy to use
D :  Well it's i think i guess
A :  Visually were a with a
D :  Alright
D :  Okay
D :  How easy it is
A :  Um easy to
D :  No
D :  Oh it that's false oh
D :  Okay
B :  I'd say two as well
D :  It's as well
C :  Yeah true
D :  Till
D :  Um so i said
D :  Okay fashionable
D :  Yeah but you know i mean like an l. i think it's very fashionable she
B :  At the moment no
A :  Well
A :  I mean it's a a very chic
D :  I i would give it a one one
A :  One
D :  Well it's it's it's well that's that's just like i said tickle a it's a prototype we think that
A :  I give it a one
A :  Oh and a it's a product hey right
C :  Well i'd give it like three or four
D :  Okay
A :  About a two
D :  See yeah to to uh
C :  Then an a fashion
A :  Two or three
D :  If that's okay yeah
A :  Two point oh
D :  Oh well let's see does it feel to it
B :  No they're all all the customer
D :  I'd say like
B :  The shape of it uh
D :  Yes
A :  And it's
D :  Is there should be first
A :  It is very ergonomically designed it's gonna be
D :  Hmm
D :  I think it feels good it's
A :  I think so too
D :  I didn't feel
D :  You
D :  Mm
D :  We think it's
B :  I'd say it
D :  Okay
A :  Right and which is true
D :  That was thinking oh no it's fine here in your project manager of
A :  Is it technologically innovative
A :  And he can we do have here you go right ahead
D :  Yeah i mean and it had to have voiced i mean the phrase recognition on it
D :  Right and you you so you see what you know there's a recharger so now i'm here but i think it's it's it's it should be discussed uh yeah sell
A :  Right we're able to deal with that kind of chip
B :  The chip yeah
B :  A bit on the prototype
B :  That's because it's on
A :  Right
A :  Okay and we just
D :  They'd yes and i would well what
D :  It doesn't
D :  What else let me for to be technologically innovative but we don't have to teach and it doesn't cover anything other than t. v. so i'd probably give it a three
A :  Included
A :  Well we don't have
A :  Oh like change the channel l. a.
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Didn't know what it is for just a t. v. remote it's a very advanced
D :  But it's just a t. v.
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  He wants it it it is to switch but that that is little bit yeah so i'd give it to
A :  Last criteria is it
C :  Squishy oh
A :  Well we've cover
C :  It's just trendy basically
D :  If you use so it's a very clear all things question for it
B :  It's capable of being squishy and fruity
D :  Yeah okay
D :  Next slide sell our model slower so we try it was just cook a pear is a winner and a half of what was a way that's a good idea
D :  I don't know why it's low isn't it was yeah yeah it's true that it's it's think
C :  Hmm
A :  Very
A :  Very good alright
D :  Mm
D :  Yes
A :  Oops
A :  Okay so now
D :  It's it's that's that's you want so it's yeah it's a one or c.
A :  And initially excel spreadsheet and
A :  All in together based on what components we're
A :  In our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro
D :  So as you know
A :  If so we can proceed if that we need to
D :  Mm
A :  Okay me
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh
A :  Um it's not
D :  E. r.
A :  He and and that's
B :  Yep
D :  Uh-huh
D :  One
A :  Are you are
D :  Yeah but it is you know you worked with
A :  Continuity
A :  Triple a.s were gonna do
A :  At one battery
D :  So
D :  Yeah that's uh still of them
D :  Okay i were to that so
A :  I think i i think the people who
D :  So it's not leave it yeah
D :  Yeah that's
A :  Damn thing like try
D :  Uh start
D :  We're gonna be it's right yeah yeah it's
A :  Um section
A :  We're gonna need this
A :  Just do the voice
D :  It's single curve
D :  Mm
D :  Mm
D :  Uh it
D :  Yeah yeah
D :  Here we are plastic and special colour
A :  It is the single
C :  Last week
C :  Okay
D :  Yeah it's it's it's so it's it's the opposite side but it's it's it's yeah it's all
A :  Your case
A :  I'm here interface
B :  That's a pushbutton see right there
D :  And it's it's it's
B :  It it scroll-wheel or push the
B :  The phase
D :  Mm
A :  Oh that's just
D :  Uh
D :  But well we
D :  What actually wanting to what we want to tell them and one for this one each for each side of it
A :  Or we can just go
B :  Type a button where have
B :  A scroll on the side it's a push button
D :  So so it's
D :  Oh
C :  That twenty nine means like you have both scrolls uh
D :  So yeah
D :  Okay i think he's i would you like because there's like a one or three three here and then because it's not to be on the same
C :  Pushbuttons
A :  So
A :  Right i think she is i think work or decide about is do we need to put two here
D :  Claim when you press the button there's a
B :  Yeah
D :  Additional signals on the side so was i gonna be an extra one on each side is
D :  No that is is is that should use it for our story because of what each side one on top i mean it's fine it's it just comes up the same as twenty nine what was happening okay
C :  Interface as as i know
A :  Let's just
A :  T. or would it be three
D :  That's not that's the buttons and uh
A :  "'kay" and we're gonna
D :  They're special colour
A :  Button supplements the buttons are
D :  Um there are there special form "'cause" they're intended
D :  And they're special material
A :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Or whatever
B :  Right
D :  Oh
D :  Mm
A :  Um right
D :  So we should i
A :  Loss and
A :  Yeah well
A :  Right
A :  We can go to
D :  Uh huh it's it's
A :  Now we're gonna talk about the project
D :  Uh huh
A :  And when our satisfied with you
D :  All plastic
A :  Whole process and the result
D :  We have about it
A :  Um did we have a lot of room for
D :  I'm not sure
A :  We
A :  Have a lot of room for individual leadership
D :  Uh teamwork
D :  It's
D :  Two
A :  Um teamwork
A :  To produce our little right there
A :  And if we find a new ideas
D :  And we just discuss it is that's true
A :  Question is
D :  What that is
A :  Discuss sure
A :  Alright
B :  Quick that stifled for quite a creativity by the company it's all

A :  Mm
A :  And how did you feel about the whole
D :  Overall i mean i thought we did a good job one
D :  We have to choose this will be control over
D :  My sitting just going to be you know actions
D :  We wanted to do with that
A :  She
A :  Right and we got say over
D :  So
A :  What
A :  Have technologically advanced should be and a half fashionable
D :  And more fashion forward and you can
D :  Uh we have a t. v.
A :  Which i kind of
D :  Okay but
A :  Um what about um the teamwork
D :  It or okay
A :  I think it it did you work well together
B :  Well no there's there's sky
