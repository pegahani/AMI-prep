A :  So
D :  So also
B :  But then you might
C :  So we forgot that to switch again
B :  Boss
C :  They they cost
D :  Maybe maybe maybe me
A :  Okay
A :  So we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product
A :  Okay
A :  And here's the agenda for this meeting
A :  Um the scroll and see if you boring wants to start again
A :  And start taking minutes afterwards you guys gonna give a presentation or one their products that i can
A :  Six and then she should go with that but still
A :  And
A :  I'm gonna evaluate it
A :  Then we wanna talk about finance of got our lovely excel spreadsheet that not not not five minutes so that's
A :  And
C :  You know it up
A :  Uh yep and we're gonna evaluate the product and close
A :  Got forty minutes to do this and we should be
A :  Finding much time keep this one on schedule
A :  So
A :  You're
A :  Thing and and
A :  Or is it is it in
C :  Third third thing
C :  Yeah and private thingy
C :  Yeah
A :  Who wants that
B :  Great okay
B :  Back of all time
C :  Um
C :  Yeah so what we ended up late
C :  Action course estimated by our manufacturing department then um the research department which is r.s
C :  Is the the fifteen point eight euros so much but
C :  Uh-huh minutes there a unit price unit production price cost
B :  You price
C :  Um
C :  We implement the the basic functions
C :  Which is just t. v. functions plus
C :  The locator
C :  Which was one of the marketing things
C :  Great deal
C :  Scroll-wheel
C :  For uh
C :  The
C :  The channels and uh we implemented that but the the way of putting then you when you're functionaries i think
C :  Your favourite channels functionality in the scroll
A :  Is that thing you through channels it
C :  Yeah
B :  Scrolling through fear it's list
A :  Oh okay okay
C :  So i think you know something
A :  Uh case yeah that's true that's
C :  Maybe this is for to use and
C :  And um yeah that was the result
A :  Okay
A :  I like that the the the logo on there as well
B :  It's very prominent
A :  The front so this is the
B :  So
B :  Here
B :  T. v.s it says that the cradle unit and this is the
B :  Actual remote itself
B :  Um
B :  So the scroll bar is the scroll wheel is this the screen
B :  Little scrolling guy here um and then the volume controls are here here
A :  Okay
B :  Uh you've got the keypad this is the numbers uh
B :  From zero to nine and ten this is the power button
B :  Uh we have our um
B :  We have the enter button and uh
B :  Was the other button here
B :  Is the teletext
C :  That is this the start the two
B :  The programme button
C :  Program yeah
B :  Yeah the programme button
A :  Okay see
B :  So this this but not be useful for the favourites and for programming your uh
B :  That um
B :  That type of television you in use
B :  So um
B :  But plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red there it is like a rubber covering so you can see that what it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gone be rubber so
A :  That's pretty cool
B :  It's pretty hard to actually damage it
B :  Um
A :  Is that could that be easy to use for the scroll wheel to be rotated f. eight ones on it
B :  Yeah that might be a possible
B :  Uh but uh
B :  Possible problem but
C :  No i think
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  No i i guess it depends on the stuff that's awful lot
B :  Yeah it depends on if it
B :  Sliding but i think it's pretty ergonomic you can feel it
A :  Mm
A :  It's good i think you know this is gonna be satellite and uh
B :  Yeah of course
A :  And within that
B :  Well this is clay
A :  Mm
A :  Yeah me too you have to reach a one
B :  Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach but i think we might scale down the final model of it
A :  I know that would make sense
B :  This is a bit larger than it would be but
A :  Cool um
C :  That on a normal uh huh
A :  In hold it so that was was the marketing perspective
D :  Well it's
D :  Oh i like
D :  I mean you guys gave me more than i was that was on that
D :  Because we've that's really marketable features and that's
D :  I think
D :  Yeah
B :  Computer can demonstrate that
C :  Yeah okay
B :  Uh page inability
C :  Yeah you have like the the base station with the um
C :  The little button for the
C :  Where's my remote
D :  Oh well
B :  Yeah
C :  Locator function
A :  Yeah that's it
D :  That's great
D :  That's good
B :  Um
D :  Three feature
A :  And
B :  Yeah
A :  So i may get the fact that this button
A :  Yeah silly
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  So you can take
D :  Is that would be denying you can
D :  Yeah he'll be a cost
A :  I find it
B :  No the
A :  To do it
A :  Of those but they did it to charge off of
B :  Exactly that's exactly what those are four and um there's one other feature that we're debating but we decided to go against it is um you could
A :  Okay i think
B :  Think it it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this thing yeah it
A :  Yeah
B :  It's a kind of
B :  There should be something there but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there
B :  And we we don't wanna actually be hitting the power button like that
A :  But maybe if you have a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of ah one thing and scrolling "'cause" then it would need to be hat and also isn't it
B :  So maybe in a final design phase we might treat that a little bit
A :  Okay
A :  That is that's like the options for like different data models and things as well be some of that
D :  Yep right
D :  The the
A :  So is that the the final colour scheme as well uh
B :  Oh no this is
D :  No no
B :  Just what we had to work with that time
A :  Okay
B :  So well with the colour scheme up the marketing people
A :  But
B :  Careful
A :  It enough
A :  The scroll-wheels problem with them not big
D :  Well i mean if
A :  I don't think it is that if this guy who wants to touch it and
D :  My suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silver some blacks like most of the televisions
A :  Hmm
D :  You know someone that's over some blacks
A :  Okay
A :  Not for that
A :  Uh the skill yes
A :  Okay so are we done
A :  Three this presentation
C :  Yeah
C :  Oh
A :  Then uh
C :  Oh
D :  So yeah gonna find my uh
D :  My folder up they're gonna do my note that the board
A :  Eddie okay
D :  Yeah
D :  So
D :  To
A :  Can i get your get tax stuff from your shared folder now
D :  No it's not in there because i have a computer problem and i
A :  Oh i see is
D :  Like i couldn't i couldn't create it
D :  I couldn't do it in the powerpoint
D :  Yeah i think if that is really strange cable
D :  So what i had
D :  Basically go on from the powerpoint format
D :  Is that um
D :  Yeah yeah like this will last
D :  Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt choose changing situations in the
D :  In the meeting room
C :  That
C :  Yeah
D :  So what we had if we had the method
D :  That's not a spell method is it
B :  No way
D :  No way uh
D :  Can you
D :  So this doesn't go so fast as well
D :  And when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product so
D :  And uh
D :  To me with this product we get to
D :  We get
D :  Basically three things to market
D :  We've got three features
D :  We have the uh characteristics
D :  And we have uh of i don't know what we call the other part would be got you know the the
D :  The
D :  Court
D :  Corporate
D :  Well maybe
D :  But the corporation is ten minute right okay
D :  So the features i think we get a square all we've got the uh the locator we've got the durability we've got the dependability we've got you know the features that makes
D :  A unique product
D :  Um
D :  The characteristics a talk about we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics we have environmental least sensitive
D :  Um and the corporation we're talking about
D :  Where were in you were in new company
D :  We're wanting to make a name for itself or wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price
D :  One thing i would want to to see
D :  Is um
D :  Is can we can we get a lifetime
D :  Uh i guarantee on this product a normal use guarantee
D :  Which means that this product for the for the life of of
D :  The life use if it should have a technical problem that we could replace it no cost
D :  That was something that would be interested in
D :  Um
D :  So all of that way that they're going in a great detail we have that we have a product that has the features in the characteristics in the background i believe to make it marketable i believe uh the cost of of of thirty thirty five to
D :  To fifty euros
D :  We're gonna be competitive
D :  And we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche
D :  Um
A :  You would you argue that we're better going for the higher cost down bring it down to twenty
A :  Five as we probably could
A :  But warning a profit margin
D :  That that would be uh
D :  That would be i think a decision best be the corporate um
D :  I i am for my evaluation based on what the competition is i if i think
D :  That that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense then the mass market sense
A :  Uh-huh
D :  But i'm sure i'm sure open to to market is another direction
D :  Which you guys can put a great product
D :  An attack a state think it to
D :  There's nobody else is putting this this combination of of ingredients together be a limitations i see this as it were focus on television only
D :  Um
D :  That's the only that's the only drawback i see that put all these other features i think people one thing i'm i'm hoping for these people are not gonna even notice
D :  There's gonna be somebody going on with a list this thing doesn't work from i. d. v. d. in my but i like these other thing so they keep it it'll take it back
A :  And are actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a with a button that those features
A :  At some point and it does not fundamentally different thing
D :  Well what it what i thought i said i had this can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgrade a ball
D :  No uh like a like a um a same card in uh
D :  You know um
D :  In a telephone
D :  You know is there a call it and it can be make a card and so after
C :  We knew we knew mean it's some more buttons if it were to work on some other stuff
D :  Uh-huh
D :  But you phone and
C :  We will yeah we could get another version of it that actually works
D :  Yeah "'cause" if if we can make this unit and credible then would
D :  Yeah but can we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything but that's that was just an idea i had like to maybe all the editions
A :  Does that the rest of making unusable as well or making it less
A :  It because at the moment is actually very straightforward to look all the buttons you know what to do it's very simple and this box
D :  Yep
A :  Mm is the rest of that
D :  Yeah anyway that's uh
A :  Okay so we can talk about finance there
A :  So all i have a little spreadsheet for a spare
A :  Uh i was wondering you when you talked about fifteen twenty euros as one and how you cannot about think yeah
B :  Oh that was it just our technical team it up the um production cost of the individual units
A :  Okay so
A :  Have
A :  But the spreadsheet yeah
A :  For this
C :  Break off
A :  Made of view assumptions here and that i'm assuming that are part about that
A :  We can make for a cost of four euros come to solar cells
A :  I think it's probably fair considering that that we have an hourish
A :  Manufacturing a parrot that was already
B :  Uh huh
A :  Uh
A :  And i'm assuming that these
A :  Locator beacon
A :  Do you know the
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
C :  D. v. d.
A :  It can be made for this and that that that that can be made for a somewhat place to
A :  Uh an l. c. display
A :  Uh and i i i
A :  It do you think that's fair come from our manufacturing
B :  Yeah um i do think we that we we we uh don't need the advanced chip-on-print we only need the uh
B :  The regular chip on print so
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah maybe them miscalculation there
A :  Okay
A :  So we're down to sixteen point
B :  And we uh we have a single curved uh
A :  Is that single curved uh the the double curved
B :  Uh i think that
A :  Well not entirely sure what so
D :  But we've got a curve in a group i don't know whether that
B :  It's single curved
A :  You think yeah okay
A :  I'm not convinced
A :  But we save one euro that we yeah
A :  So we come when you tend to
B :  It's it's a little bit more than for single curve so yeah it's fifteen point eight that's what we came up with it
A :  And that the speech so
B :  Okay
A :  Same here and that that we do we have any
A :  We have special form the way
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah we did
A :  So that's yeah
A :  But the any special colour little uh i don't say for one reason so more than i don't think more
B :  That's a very special it's pretty
A :  Okay so or
A :  Then scroll wheel rubber basically we have
A :  At that is that's intended to be a button as well or just uh
A :  Scroll
B :  That's a scroll
A :  Just a scroll it's not one of the schools for for example if that's when you could push it then be a button
B :  Um no we just use it as a scroll
A :  Okay
A :  Then we have fifteen point eight euros
B :  It was a pretty accurate is that it's
A :  It wasn't bad
C :  We would get
B :  You
C :  What's up
A :  Okay so
A :  We're on to be
B :  That's frightening we i care
C :  Yeah
A :  We're under the power on the back part of the
A :  Presentation where we have a look at the criterias that the whole exactly and
A :  Criteria that called is is gonna
A :  And we can use that to
A :  Tell
A :  Has it gone
A :  Any any
A :  But i don't have we done today
B :  I think we did pretty well
A :  I think that uh that uh that looks pretty spectacular
D :  No i think we've come up with the with the attractive marketable
D :  Um
D :  Product and end time so
A :  Any other change it thoughts
A :  Okay so that well that um
A :  Room for creativity
C :  That was
A :  Mm hmm hmm
B :  Sure if there's plenty room
A :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh yeah i think we ended up being quite good to the
B :  Apple innovative i'd
D :  Yeah well we
B :  Well innovative ideas
D :  We we kind of broke
D :  We can at least adjusted
D :  Every
D :  Every criteria they gave us
D :  Because we just we still have the the teletext keep will be in a saying right
B :  Uh-huh
D :  We raise the price of it
D :  Better to just new technology to it
D :  So you know if this thing flies than we've we've adjusted are broken every
D :  Every or do they gave us
A :  I've read in s. l. it's still a remote control
D :  Yeah
A :  That no yeah but we did we did break with the spec so i'll but i guess
A :  The the uh
D :  But then like i mean what i say we have we had i believe we have room creativity "'cause" what this is we did it
A :  We different for the report back to the bosses
A :  Yeah those i think there are reasonable flexible watches over the whole
A :  Changing the spec thing
C :  He was more of a team more exciting than rover but it should pass project
A :  I agree
D :  Course use of yeah
A :  It's energy
D :  Yes
D :  Synergistic yeah
B :  As like a synergy
A :  Hmmm team or
A :  Yeah yeah i was uh uh
A :  Would it be think of the
A :  Meeting room i guess is important thing here
B :  These tables so
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  This falls off and
B :  Yep
A :  Uh the whiteboard worked really well with the innocent
B :  Yeah
C :  You must have very long shared that's
C :  Way far dial apple
C :  Mike
A :  Uh-huh model well
C :  But the lapel
B :  Lapel
A :  Okay oh alright
C :  At all of the crotch
C :  But
A :  That's that's the end it's quite
D :  You know what they're good at what the recording you know from have microphone is your lunch digesting you know
C :  Yep
A :  No idea
C :  I would get the idea that that uh
A :  Mm the more pizza for me i
A :  So you have it depend team and alright it's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works
C :  "'cause" you using it pops it on
C :  Yeah
A :  Well i'm i'm not convinced that that's all
A :  I've been one of them been wondering about all the the c. d.s look like they're
A :  That would still that looks like it would be that way around
C :  Use them like that
B :  It does right
A :  But it feels more comfortable what you call it a then
B :  Eight euros
A :  And ah okay
A :  Uhuh
A :  Okay so that they to make this out and out
A :  New ideas of events
D :  New ideas for the for the product or four of the the the
D :  The environment or whatever
A :  What was the board then
A :  Uh for the product
B :  Well we had the favourites list and the scroll bar we have a cradle
B :  And uh our um our remote call feature
A :  You can not quite that
C :  And to me i guess
A :  Then for the meeting them as anything anymore
C :  Comfortable headsets a bit nice
A :  Yeah with
D :  Well i mean
D :  Very remote control microphone could be yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  My solution to all these cables but i'm sure that is to some justification for these things i don't know about
D :  And of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this have you know it's not in the
D :  It's not been cool offerings well but
D :  I don't think that's the
D :  That's where the ball
C :  Put it in words
A :  Okay so
A :  The costs within the budget
C :  Mm
D :  No
A :  Not buying and then really that something may
A :  The costs under twelve fifty euros not gonna change or so and the twenty years to build so would it
A :  Uh
A :  Cost within the budget
A :  Mm not there is no budget to be on there
A :  Is the project evaluated i think so yeah then celebration
A :  And that's it
D :  Yeah
C :  Free to provide about the cafeteria
B :  Our rat
A :  Uh i don't know how to do that
A :  Uh yeah
C :  Well wrote that one
