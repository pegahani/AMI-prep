B :  Oh i
A :  Um not almost there's one more thing i have to get out of the
A :  I have to make sure that this
A :  Attachment well open
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Okay
A :  Will open that one times right
A :  In the meantime
A :  Closing things down
A :  Oh okay
A :  Let's see what it is think uh it's
A :  To come up together or disappear one of them are
A :  How we came up again
A :  Good good
A :  Are we ready to start
A :  Okay it's now quarter of four
A :  This is of another forty minute
A :  One so it will be an ad should for twenty five
A :  Mm "'kay"
A :  Right a rich and that is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes
A :  Then for the two of you present your prototype
A :  And for you to get um sarah present the evaluation criteria
A :  We don't have a fine it's aspect which is it a spreadsheet
A :  An excel spreadsheet
A :  And i know which are all thinking of all my um because we're only given a forty minute timing three to get it all in the including a production evaluation
A :  So we're going to make a very fast track
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  And as you can see that's
A :  What we do next one this like
A :  So the first thing i have to do is close this
A :  So that i can get too
A :  I see to
D :  Right
A :  I need to open mind
A :  O. p. g. and yeah
D :  Agenda three
A :  No that that uh with the minutes from the previous
A :  Minutes
A :  That should be ten minutes yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Um from meeting three
A :  Is that right with you if i don't switch it to
A :  Sure well just use it as as
A :  "'cause" we i can more easily flip it
A :  Okay um
A :  Obviously all those we're here for the last meeting
A :  We reviewed the previous minutes before that
A :  Um each of you major presentations
A :  Um
A :  We discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in this presentations
A :  Be
A :  Market trend of fruit and veg uh-huh
A :  Spongy
A :  A fancy and how we get more than technologically innovative and that more than easy
A :  Um we decided chip one
A :  Pray would be used
A :  Um are we we'd use plastic with the rubber casing i think was the consensus
A :  Powered by kinetic energy
A :  There was no decision made on a curvatures or double curve which are
A :  Or straight to um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of slacked
A :  Um looking like a scroll
A :  But it's really a pushbutton technology excuse my spelling
A :  Um
A :  That was actually in use
A :  That is top of find the scenes is pushbutton which we are going to take have a very good
A :  A grasp on doing that in production
A :  Um
A :  We decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg
A :  Might be a separate product that could be suggested to management
A :  Um and i i suggested
A :  Um yellow with black buttons for the company logo a slogan an image might be a good idea
A :  Based on the requirements that it and provided to us
A :  Um
A :  We did have a few production issues
A :  And coordination
A :  Of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints
A :  And we ran out of time
A :  Um huh
A :  We had to follow that up and prepare for the last one
A :  And i'm be close to sit ran out of time
A :  Is that a fair
C :  Yes
A :  Presentation of what happened
A :  Okay back to
A :  This meeting
A :  Um we're down to the prototype presentation
B :  Mm
C :  Alright
A :  Over to you
B :  Mm right
C :  Well
A :  Woo to
C :  Yeah well i see is made a which are not enough yellowed though
C :  This is one
C :  But i made
A :  R. r.
C :  And it says um
C :  Curved easy to hold
C :  And how it's it's a small with
C :  Take easy buttons this is
C :  Like a scroll but they are pushbuttons and they enter
C :  Take it into different menus course we need
C :  Someone who's experienced with that
C :  Television so i like the minutes the infrared thing that's gonna zap that the television um
C :  Uh i'm not quite sure have to make that spot
C :  I'm sure will work uh this is on off switch "'cause" i think we do need that i think it's a a nice
C :  Balance
C :  And it's gonna have the logo in printed on it
C :  Uh in that
C :  Um
C :  As for whites actually made of all the functions of these buttons as up down left and right
C :  In the different menus
C :  At position
C :  The p. c. no just means
C :  Right
C :  Ready on it easy to see them a feature of it is just a simple design
C :  Simple
C :  Lack of
C :  Um
C :  Buttons all over the place right
C :  Foreign
C :  Curved
C :  Kind of solution hand helds
C :  Makes you feel nice to hold
C :  Uh material
C :  I think he's gonna talk about quite a bit but i think
C :  We have two different options because
C :  We did make another one which what uh
C :  Is in the shape of the now nicest if you can imagine s. as yellow with black buttons
A :  Mm hmm
C :  Like just like a spare the shape of a banana out which is
C :  Also it makes it easy to hold and feels good
C :  And as a similar
C :  Sort of scroll push button
C :  Technology just slightly different sign
A :  I
C :  Also with on off switch
C :  Um it's infra-red
C :  Uh
C :  I hadn't isn't it
C :  In
C :  Hard smith plastic
C :  So
C :  Light oh
C :  Well i don't know
C :  So like
C :  I guess like an existing remote control but mould it's it's move
C :  Whereas
C :  Oh as we saw it with this one or makes it much just we're gonna see what you thought
C :  That at a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons
C :  So we have the two options we can fall either this move hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints
C :  And what we
C :  Well what conclusion region we discuss it
C :  Uh material yeah so i have to say that material
C :  Can you scroll down and then see what else
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Well colour i think
C :  I. e.
C :  Definitely have a preference towards
C :  Bright yellow with black buttons because that's the
C :  Company colours
C :  But if anybody's got any other suggestions am i willing
C :  So you consider them as well
C :  So
C :  Just depends what you think about these ideas
C :  And
C :  If um yeah maybe keep their see what you think about that
B :  Um well i don't have very much to add um
B :  Be the case oops
B :  The on off button just cough up or shut be the case can be i. the um
B :  Spongy no but all all plastic not actually sure about combination of the two but it can be hard to lose we have the technology to do that
B :  Um
B :  And as for the the actual components um
B :  Uh steph just said this is a
B :  Quite a cheap device to manufacture we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide more functionality we need
B :  Um be um
B :  The diode that actually does the um
B :  Infrared is at the end that's the store called nominal it's just a
B :  In the end of this
B :  Fashion
B :  Um
B :  So that's for material colour well uh
B :  Staff six point one colour um
B :  We we don't have any particular restrictions on that
B :  Yeah i think
C :  At that
B :  That so we've got sick of it
C :  As for as for the
C :  Fruit or organic feel like this one is obviously fruitshaped
C :  This one hasn't
B :  You know not
C :  No yeah this one has no obvious connections to
C :  Fruit but because it's right in the mold it's
C :  Kinda makes you think sort of organic
C :  Touchy feely kitty it's more like yeah you'd expect it to be like
C :  A child's
C :  Sorry tory remote control instead of a real one
C :  Which i like that
C :  Sort of image
C :  It's very
C :  Begin champion child friendly and it's
B :  You can't examine the pressure see how they feel in the hand
C :  Hold on to see you know curvatures it to your liking
A :  Oh i see the own office and back
B :  Yeah so so that your index finger automatically
B :  Goes straight to it
C :  You don't at a rate it comes after all
A :  And then you can use your thumb
B :  And it was partly but for the design that
C :  Yeah
B :  But it could be moved if if marketing feel is important have the on off button and a different place
A :  I could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with uh
C :  Break or or
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  We see that's why
C :  Hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because there's be rigid
D :  I like the fact that on button um
D :  The keys it's a prominent
A :  Mm
D :  It's really kind of uh
C :  Yeah that we really like we really like that design i mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys
C :  Like like like a compass point you know
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Just up down left and right and we think we could make uh quite a feature is like the
C :  The ipod scroll wheel
D :  Yeah
D :  That's also like texting
C :  But s. r.
D :  You know
C :  Yeah yeah yeah i mean it
B :  Uh-huh
D :  I
C :  That's what makes me think of mobile phones hours try i was thinking
C :  Business um i guess what does that remind me of
D :  Yeah
B :  And it's a very simple design that's not a lot to go wrong the components a cheap to make
C :  It's text and
D :  It's also in terms of um
D :  Been lost
D :  It's quite looks quite different
D :  You know i i i have several for remotes
D :  And they look the same at the at the closing after
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah this is really identify know
C :  Everything is we do need to develop our technology of
C :  We actually had to programme the menus
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And what sort of
C :  You
C :  Text boxes can appear the palm of the screen
C :  But we do definitely think that it's a viable option
A :  Okay
A :  Be
A :  Next item is evaluation
D :  Okay
A :  Yeah that's that's if you finish
D :  Um
C :  Uh yeah we're finished
B :  Uh-huh
D :  So it take you know
A :  I'm sorry
A :  Right yeah
D :  Okay
D :  This is going to be a heavily interactive
D :  Evaluation
D :  And the method here is to evaluate new remote control in terms of the user requirements and hot trends that you spend a marketing department
D :  So
D :  This means we're going to go for the priority use that were raised by uh the consumers
D :  As well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise so i'm going to do and use the whiteboard
D :  And i've made a list of criteria to look at
D :  And so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up
D :  As the last thing but
D :  For the evaluation
D :  It's going to be one is true and seven is false
D :  Going over
D :  These different criteria so
D :  One to seven faults and i mean uh
D :  Now use the um
D :  The board
D :  Okay
D :  So
D :  Um
D :  I see
D :  Technologically innovative
D :  Easy to use trendy
D :  Buttons
D :  Access buttons
D :  Good buttons
D :  Ugly
D :  Sellable
D :  And other and fact i hope that uh it you want to do some additional
D :  Terms because these are things that um have been brought up some of them seem rather close like a overlap
C :  Yeah water crisis is that gonna go on there as well
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Price of materials
D :  Price
D :  The price up as well
C :  And like we actually know and then a place that that we can we can pretend
A :  Well we will send than forty one
D :  Um
D :  Okay so
D :  "'cause" you said
A :  No no no
D :  Um
D :  Okay
D :  So
D :  But how do we feel in terms of this is fancy
C :  It depends what what you mean by fancy really "'cause" when i think a fancy i think if it's got lots of extra
C :  Sort of fripperies and you know like
C :  A hawk curly madison which
D :  Uh-huh
C :  I call these quite and minimalist
B :  Yes the phoneme simple clean design
C :  Simple and fine but
C :  And i do see what
C :  I is heavily relied on up here it's
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Instead of pure functionality so in that respect it is quite fancy
D :  I yeah so in that respect
D :  I think we'll go with that respect
C :  I just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe
D :  Yeah
B :  We have
C :  Is that
B :  Trendy further down but
A :  L. i can't
A :  I like it
D :  Okay
B :  And i can identify home and
D :  Yeah no these are the exact terms of the um
C :  A light of a style s. r. is that that
D :  Yeah
B :  It's stylish yeah
D :  And we didn't really let's use a elegant all the the the
D :  The people the word on the street is is a
C :  Fancy
D :  Um
C :  You just pick the pen
D :  Yeah um
D :  Be yeah it's fancy so let's let's take it to the next up all
C :  What do with colour fancy that
D :  Well okay so in terms of elegant fancy
D :  Well call it you have um
D :  Do we do we think that perhaps
D :  And maybe we should say the yellow
D :  Should go with the yellow in terms of
D :  I think that's a really superior
C :  Yeah i think we need to them both yellow or black buttons it's just so we don't have any ward those to represent so that if you can just imagine banana shape with
D :  They're both
D :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  Yeah
C :  These pets as black so what we really need to decide is whether we want
C :  That's a banana shape
C :  Or just a a purely
C :  Blop or some sort of abstraction between the two that isn't that is more curved like a banana but that isn't actually recognisable as a button
D :  Yeah
D :  As a banana
C :  You know with a group so the stock and stuff
D :  I think that many of us are abstract you have to look at the yellow one and say we caught the banana
C :  So
A :  Yeah
D :  Minutes of that you i really like "'em" i like a banana
D :  But i i do like the channel
A :  The channel
C :  So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now as a as a somewhere all on a scale of in between these two
D :  No but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them
D :  A nice to this wanna buy a boat
A :  I think between the two
A :  Somewhere between the two is true
B :  Yeah i know
A :  It's more true than false about that too
D :  Okay
D :  So it's a true
D :  Um
D :  Technologically innovative
B :  I i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept i think we're using
D :  Yeah
D :  So say
B :  Simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative
D :  Say uh
D :  False
D :  Easy to use
B :  Very
C :  Yes
D :  One to seven for free
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Openly
D :  Um
A :  Trendy
D :  Trendy it's the end i say specifically spongy fruity
C :  Oh yes
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Well maybe only after a few inches and we still haven't decided a specific sponginess or specific
B :  We have to worry about how we're past will be if it's
B :  This kind of discipline on that but spongy
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah do anything that's gonna work
D :  Okay so too
C :  But
B :  Yeah
D :  Um
A :  Access but it's
D :  Either access buttons
B :  No
C :  No
A :  No
B :  That's false
D :  But this falls um
D :  Good good
D :  Well design buttons into it
A :  There are more intuitive buttons yes
D :  Buttons
D :  True
D :  Ugly
C :  New
B :  Uh
A :  No
D :  People don't spend all the other way
D :  Sellable
D :  Uh it
D :  Perky you know something people
B :  Yeah i think they are different l. a.
D :  Like oh
C :  Well it's quite a quite quite a
A :  I like it
D :  Yeah i do too
C :  It could be quite good
C :  Brown like
D :  Oh yeah
C :  Okay well i'll check
D :  And i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of
D :  Uh can we say it's cost saving
D :  With uh
C :  Oh you also think they energies or the kinetic energy
D :  Yeah with the energy
B :  Mm
C :  This is gonna be
B :  Yeah
D :  It is gonna be kinetic
C :  Environmentally friendly with a kind of
B :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah all cool say it to our costs a mean and buy a row
D :  Uh so yes
C :  Yeah but we haven't
C :  Completely developed that side of it yet so we're not completely sure about that but yeah
D :  Well
D :  You're still on that later stage
D :  Anything else
D :  Including price do you have any idea about price or other features
B :  I think uh instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop we haven't got a lot expensive components in the
A :  Yes the instincts that's true
D :  So true one or should i go to two or three
B :  I put in one of the thing that i dunno for you
D :  Okay
C :  I say maybe two "'cause" we still we need to uh get somebody in he's good with that
C :  Programming for the menus
B :  Yeah true you might be the yeah
C :  And things i mean it's not just like
A :  Yeah that's not a cheap thinking yeah
C :  It's not like and you know on a normal
B :  Yeah true
B :  True
C :  Chunky remote every button was i mean mean something different ways this one is only got
C :  The four buttons and they'll be mean everything depending on what menu
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah it's good point
C :  Yeah
C :  We need somebody to develop that
D :  Um
D :  Other
D :  Anything else you guys can think of
D :  And i'm gonna should change couple days so um that instead of of "'em" it's it's attractive
D :  And then make that true so that
C :  Yeah
D :  "'cause" i have to do an average
B :  I
D :  And then um
D :  Excess buttons
C :  Displaying no access buttons
D :  Exactly
D :  Well we're doing really well
D :  Yeah
D :  You know so it doesn't really polarity
C :  I see i see if it technologically innovative
C :  I'd say it's quite innovative because the right really many to have this menu idea instead of
D :  Uh-huh
C :  All the extra buttons
C :  I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
D :  Or l. c. d.
C :  But we had a a friend of the pushbutton market
D :  Yeah
D :  Well if you get um let me know if if any of these
D :  Um
D :  If you if you're can think of any other
D :  Um thing to change here
D :  If if if you think i should change the innovative or
D :  At other features if not all average does
A :  Okay okay
D :  Okay
A :  Mm "'kay"
D :  So
A :  For a little over carefully through the meeting in the next big thing is they
A :  Fine it's
A :  "'kay"
D :  Um
D :  Okay how that if i yeah
D :  Passes back to you
D :  And uh all the figure out the yeah it sure
A :  Right
D :  Thank you for every once top of that
A :  An issue can see it so that's the same thing
A :  Yeah i'm not lost that's all
A :  Thank goodness
A :  And we're going to be used what's called as a spreadsheet that they provide it to me
A :  Um
A :  And
A :  It says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device
A :  He hand dynamo battery kinetic
A :  Solar cells
A :  Mm "'kay"
C :  Well just kind of thing um
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
A :  What's your hand dynamo
B :  That was the crank
C :  As the wind up
A :  Oh
B :  When a crank on the side
A :  She week
A :  But uh
A :  Kinetic is um
A :  And how many of those will be need for
B :  Just one
A :  We only need one
A :  Okay
A :  I like traumatic simple chip on print
A :  And we need one of those
B :  Um yeah i think we can deal with simple
B :  Just checking that
B :  Yep simple as we just got push buttons so we can do with simple which is the strip of the cheapest
A :  Okay only need one of those
A :  Okay the case will be uncurved or flat or a single curved or double curve
A :  Looks like a somewhat all single curve
A :  "'cause" the the the trendiness
A :  It's
B :  Yeah but but we single curve isn't it um
A :  That's a one
B :  We have
C :  What is double curved me that understand
A :  And that's
B :  But i think you need to reverse the kind of
A :  Uh that's the the one that goes like this
B :  Yeah
C :  Oh no we don't need that
B :  Yeah i i think we need that price of them the banana one single curve here
A :  Right
C :  Single curved so it's uh
A :  Now single curve
A :  Okay case material supplements
A :  Plastic wood rubber titanium special colour
C :  I
C :  I just wanna say plastic
A :  We have the special colour
A :  And she
A :  Do we say plastic
B :  Yeah quickly some what ifs "'cause" you maybe i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself but it depends on the cost i guess
D :  Uh-huh ah okay
A :  Yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Welcome back
A :  If we can do the rubber being at it
A :  At the moment that's for we are
A :  Interface button push button interface
C :  It's just a time
C :  Yeah
A :  That's what we're using isn't it
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yep we need to say how many buttons all
A :  Whoops don't want that
B :  What is it just one
A :  Not yet
A :  Um
A :  No it just says push button interface
A :  Button supplements they'll be in a special colour
A :  Of black
A :  And the buttons
A :  What what's the buttons made of
B :  Uh no be rubber yep
A :  Rubber
A :  So we need one of them
A :  Yeah are they any special form
C :  Well yeah
C :  Like
C :  The
C :  Compress point one
B :  I see
B :  These are the special material mean the plastic is not a special material "'cause"
B :  I think they can be plastic
A :  "'cause" the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top
B :  Yeah they could be plastic we don't have to have rubber buttons
B :  Because we haven't got a double curved case
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah that could be plastic
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  Let's put that rubbery and then
A :  Of the case material supplements
B :  It's just one is that
A :  We we need one of them
A :  Um
A :  And the total cost has been calculate it is nine pounds only have the the twelve and a half we were allowed
B :  What were in
D :  Yeah
A :  Worry
A :  Oh
A :  That's that's
B :  More profit
C :  Great
A :  Okay
A :  I'm going to say use this
A :  Into our
A :  Desktop
A :  Project documents
A :  Okay
A :  As our project document
B :  You you need to doubleclick on a look at it
A :  Bit
A :  Yeah
A :  Are we are
A :  That's the only x. l. document will be in there
A :  So it's there for old lost
A :  Okay so are the under twelve fifty yes go to the project evaluation next slide
C :  Yes
A :  Alright
A :  Um the project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity
A :  Mm
A :  Leadership
C :  Yeah
A :  Teamwork
D :  Yeah it's
A :  Means
A :  Of having whiteboard the digital pens know like i'm good thanks
C :  And play doh
A :  Aha
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah yeah plate it was best i thought
A :  But
C :  Yeah well could i mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying well we quite on this but imagine it rained uh
C :  So much to adjust to go and
C :  You know
C :  This is it is it'll wear off
A :  "'kay"
A :  So
A :  We went over all those things somewhere satisfied with all the above
A :  Um did we find any new ideas
D :  I think with the marketing element uh uh
D :  Fruitshaped i i mean i
D :  I really open my yes
C :  Yeah
C :  Spongy
D :  I i only speak and so on
C :  And i'd never heard of that can have to
C :  Energy before
B :  Yeah
C :  So could work is the design team because we
B :  Yeah i think we're getting messy
B :  I'm not sure why is
B :  Mm great but
A :  So we actually work well as a group
B :  I think so
A :  Right are the costs within the budget
C :  Oh yes
A :  Yes is the project evaluated yes
D :  Yes
B :  Yes
C :  Yeah it's
B :  Yes ohio we have other
D :  I can give you a number ah
A :  Aha
D :  It's that the average evaluation score is one point eight eight so it means that you know i can i can spell that
D :  There were six
D :  True or ones
D :  Four
D :  Um
D :  Pardon me too
D :  It's almost true or close to true
D :  So that was four points and then not one for seven point so seventeen divided by nine where
D :  Between one and two i would say that that excellent
D :  In terms of uh
D :  How how much we hear to the ideals of the uh marketplace
C :  Yeah
C :  And they they only false one is because we've chosen
D :  To maintain old technology
C :  It's the key press simple
D :  Exactly
C :  Old technology which if it works preferably well i see no point in improving on
B :  Uh-huh
C :  It works
B :  Absolutely and it's good it's within budget
C :  So
D :  Yes
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So we detect uh so i think
C :  Excellent one
A :  Alright
C :  It is
A :  And we've therefore we have to do final questionnaire and do the meeting summary i have the final report too
A :  Present
A :  Um and then
