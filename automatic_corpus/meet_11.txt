A :  Mm
D :  Oh
C :  Oh
A :  I
D :  So do we need to retrain mic on how to put is mike on
C :  Thanks
D :  Can you give it all by himself as to
A :  I don't know
D :  Apple
C :  Probably not
C :  Tutsis
C :  In listening to like a piece too much
D :  So
D :  I believe uh kind of uh
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Alright we get some science stuff read yes
C :  Or not
B :  Or not
D :  Just when you do something exciting
D :  Number um a normal yeah
A :  Get ready to go
B :  Already
A :  Okay so we've got conceptual design meeting we've we've all got exciting ideas now
C :  There we have all those well
D :  It's really a a
B :  We did
A :  And fixation in this
A :  So the user agenda
A :  Our agenda
A :  Um
A :  But what i'm gonna tell
A :  For that
A :  But what we're gonna there
A :  I'm gonna take some knocks
A :  Well the presentation
A :  And then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions no
A :  Yep
B :  Alright
A :  Well gonna say hopefully be have to
A :  So
A :  But what you guys talk before we make decisions
A :  Um does anyone really want to go first
B :  I guess i'll go first
A :  You too
A :  What's
B :  Component i think
A :  But this
B :  That's it
C :  You don't have my name
B :  My name is
D :  Jose him and it's
A :  Miss name
B :  My name is name
A :  Hi name
C :  My name is in the amount i yeah
A :  Huh
C :  I thought
C :  I think
B :  So i had to the cinema right
D :  No i'm a
B :  To look inside your it really all looking remote control
B :  Um you've got
B :  Uh pretty it
B :  Uh pretty that circuit board here and you've got all these buttons which kind of press down little rubber
B :  No these into these little holes that
A :  Well broken remote control right yeah
B :  Well rock in a remote control
B :  So you've also got um you get a chip here here batteries here and some sort electronics
B :  Um
D :  It is well you can kind yeah it is
C :  Yeah that's the thing the in
D :  Did you ever
A :  Hmmm you press this
B :  So you've got here's here's a transistor in this amplifies your signal
B :  Um you've got leds here and the end of the uh
B :  Uh and the and the printed circuit board
B :  Um you've got a couple diodes here for i dunno who and what that
A :  And and uh
B :  So
B :  Exactly
B :  So um we've got uh it it in this in this uh drawing he are in this example here this is the eighteen and
B :  Um
B :  Uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Chip
B :  But uh i dunno
B :  Us to double a. batteries this is pretty standard remote
B :  So here options for a power sources
B :  You can use a basic battery which we've already discussed um a a tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that
B :  I don't know that's really
C :  Exactly
B :  I dunno yes
B :  "'kay" guys they are they
B :  I've heard it's
C :  I
D :  I'd i i got a flashlight
D :  And uh
B :  You shake it
D :  Yeah but it's interesting "'cause" you shake it like this
D :  Ah like this
B :  Yeah
B :  That flexible it is a
D :  As all the camera
B :  The kinetic provision of energy
B :  So that's like that flashlight we have to shake it
B :  Uh we've got solar cells which i don't think is very good idea because um we could not use your remote at night to make it oh that sounds
A :  Okay
B :  And if and we've got our cradle i i park real idea
A :  Okay so the basic uh battery versus greatly a
B :  That are either screen oh i think it's yeah
A :  Okay
C :  I like the kinetic
B :  Yeah
A :  Oh and a whole thing because you could sell as a novelty this should be actually see this from any theory
B :  Yeah
B :  Well is it is more uh i mean it is more eco friendly than that
B :  But not cradle "'cause" you still using power off agreed with the cradle
B :  So
B :  Um
B :  Uh case design we have our choices in materials and traces in the general shapes that we can do
B :  And it shows traces are
B :  A plastic latex um tight are plastic or rubber latex type thing uh wood or titanium
B :  If we do with titanium we're gonna be a limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shake the taking it
B :  And uh
A :  But we get we get is a lot but the marketing you shouldn't it
B :  I think a weighted
B :  I i can't see a
A :  No
B :  Mean use a wooden remote
D :  Yeah
B :  Just
A :  Okay
B :  Indeed technology really
B :  You know
A :  Mm
D :  Uh it to be in a more to be senses not
D :  It's not a relative we can we can are we can uh accents we whatever
D :  Whatever party put in there we can find a way of attention yeah
B :  Yeah well you may be able to do and i think this may be the best option is to combine some
B :  A couple of these um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic
B :  Inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell
B :  To make it um to make uh like i think plastic inner shell or not
B :  Um kind of a
B :  And to have the rubber out or some uh make it more durable and also maybe it i think it feels a little better than plastic
A :  He you get be clear on the rubber yeah
D :  And if you make it from it's super rubber when you drop it on the floor can bounce right back up in your hand you don't even need we need and you get it
B :  Yeah
B :  The advantage is a working with plastic and rubber is we will have a lot more um options as in terms of shape because you can next should plastic and basically initially do you want
B :  So um
B :  And then we can cover you know the
B :  Breakable bits with rubber
B :  Yeah so i'll
A :  Okay
B :  But basically these are curved and double curved i i believe that the tech department in there um
B :  And there's
B :  Message to me that they were referring to the number of
B :  Curves in the bottom i have no idea
B :  Exactly what they're talking about
B :  But that's that will be uncurved flat curved or double curved
B :  I would guess this like this panel would be kinda like a double curved words
B :  Curved um
B :  Multiple axes right i think curved means just curved in one access
B :  And double curved is
B :  Curved into it
A :  Okay
B :  Or six i've no idea
A :  I think it might mean something like
A :  That's are shape because of the cover
D :  Uh-huh yeah
B :  Oh okay
D :  Yeah that's true
B :  Wave okay
D :  Yeah that's what i assume so
B :  Makes sense okay
B :  Um okay
B :  With the interface we have the following options we can we we can use pushbuttons we can use a scroll-wheel with an integrated push button
D :  Ooh
B :  L. c. d. display
B :  Or multiple scrolling wheels
B :  Um
B :  So these are all options that the user interface guy can
B :  Oh has it has to supposed to
B :  Put together user interface
A :  Okay
B :  For electronics we have these very technical um huh
B :  Descriptions here a simple chip which is the least expensive but i have no numbers to give you
B :  You'll a chip which is that
B :  Like the medium porridge the
B :  Medium
A :  Didn't have actually any concept of what the differences between a simple chip an advanced chip
B :  Yes the difference is with a simple chip a simple chip to operate
B :  Or was in the scroll up
B :  Previous
B :  Yes okay a simple chip is required to operate pushbuttons
B :  Um an advanced chip is required to
B :  To operate um the l. c. d. display
B :  And it didn't say specifically but i
B :  I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be
B :  The scroll wheel in the multiple scroll wheels
A :  Okay
B :  So
B :  But yeah
A :  Yeah that makes sense
B :  Let's in a my presentation
A :  Presentation
A :  From
A :  I guess design would go best
A :  Next
A :  Technical functions are interface concept
C :  Oh interface concept
A :  Yeah
C :  For all it's
A :  Yes but has your name on it
C :  Well it doesn't but bode well for for it that's as well
C :  And so
C :  Some of the things to bake but um okay
C :  Um
C :  Are uh uh manufacturing division one of the uh speech recognition they say it could put it to work but um
C :  We don't think so
B :  No
C :  It it
C :  You'll be you know
C :  Be affected by the uh the speech in
B :  T. v. is working yeah
B :  I mean if if somebody says up in the middle it
B :  Television show
B :  It's gonna change the channel
C :  Yeah and and fighting for the remote would that be fun anymore and i think that's the things we
A :  What what he actually had to press a button
A :  To make it recognise so if you press and then ah
C :  That kind of wood
B :  But the ones you just press it up
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  It kind of hmm
A :  Just one thing with a button that you can use cool
D :  That's right
B :  Even still there's gonna be in a few but there's there's still will be interface from the t. v.
B :  It might not be it might not be completely confusing but
B :  I think you used to you
B :  It's still i don't think it's practical at all
B :  I think is a bad idea for a
C :  Yeah so
A :  Okay
C :  Um take in that way um oh uh
A :  You get it
C :  The the the problem but rubber buttons are
C :  The more reliable it's the the ones that little would allow us to
C :  Market our product as being
C :  You know last one to damage and more resistors those things like
C :  Spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat nice uses
C :  As it happens of remote controls um
C :  As for the
C :  Point are we making about losing it all
C :  We are small the remote control one side because ah
C :  We want
C :  It to be cool
C :  And uh design
C :  But um apparently in the um
C :  I could show us
C :  That big ears bigger um
C :  Remotes get less lost
B :  That i would believe
C :  But um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that
C :  Um so
C :  The them
C :  What i would propose is something more or less in the um
C :  Direction of what is to use the right to that slide
C :  Um but without with a light uh less complicated um
C :  Design so
C :  The numbers the volume control and channel control teletext taxes
C :  Uh the volume and channel control can just become those those are the four button or a as in if it was a round
C :  Dial
C :  And um
C :  If you just think about it as to one to the right but but the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe sent a one but teletext
A :  So we're suggesting in as a scroll-wheel thing for the volume
C :  Be not it's not a it's it's four buttons that are and across
B :  That's not a scroll wheel
A :  Oh okay okay i see
C :  So that ebay it is it taking control all of the important that's from that all along
B :  Instead of play stop rewind fast forward there that's up down louder and quiet or
A :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  Yeah so well i think we
C :  Mm go for something that size or something looks good and uh
C :  Not too proud to get lost
C :  But yet
A :  So and two
A :  Functional requirements or trendwatching
D :  No no
B :  Trend watching as a later date there
D :  Trend watching a euros
D :  Trend watching and
A :  So it's
D :  Mm right
D :  It's been so long
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  But for
D :  Well i don't know what to say when i see what i see the one i see a product that
D :  I i i don't i wanna buy i see so many of "'em" out there
D :  There's nothing about the product it makes me wanna choose at product over
D :  Other products are out there
B :  It i can not the picture
D :  Yeah yeah
B :  That's no that's not a design that's just uh that that's just something he
B :  A graphic to use to show you the layout
D :  Okay
B :  Of what the layout of the buttons might be like
D :  Okay "'cause" "'cause" right now uh i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we have a product market yeah
D :  And uh uh from from talking the mike user we have we have uh
D :  We can market it more expensive product now
D :  That's what i understand so
A :  The management said yes
D :  Hello
A :  Oh is that it's better spam
D :  And and so
D :  Yeah i'm a i'm a little bit stuck right now and that what uh what is it to them what the market
D :  Yeah it with that special or increase marketable features i don't believe the product as a consumer demand
D :  Uh i like the idea of of the scroll make in there are so many people making these products at this price right now what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique
B :  What is special and unique about a scroll
D :  Uh you know i don't
A :  It's cool
D :  Yeah it's i i guess
D :  Not at all say specially
D :  I don't say special
D :  Uh i save it it's a different like what i'm looking for is marketing its give me something different it give me a lot or price give me a higher price give me some new technology
D :  Don't give me the same thing and everybody else putting up there on the shelf it's at the same price
D :  And need something the market about this think we're we're a new forum
A :  I know that we if we did make the decision to go to create a little
D :  What
A :  Then we have that as well though
D :  It's when when we have
A :  This summer
D :  Yeah when we when we have something like a cradle or or something okay if that's it is a marketing standard i need something to market to make this product unique
B :  Right i think that too big
B :  Points that we have so far are the having a cradle and also having
B :  Of the um
B :  The actual design of the uh the case itself having like this like rubber shell made with the plastic into your hand in it look really nice
B :  Um and it's also be really durable
D :  We could use another one i made it this report uh you know the information are we discussing here
B :  Right yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And and so on so uh yeah when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now
D :  Um
D :  Uh my personal preferences that we make some adjustment in the cost i do or or develop an integrated new techno technology
D :  That's that is the next step is technology and then there's technology which we're moving into the next phase
D :  And so uh we're gonna have to new technology to enhance the marketability
D :  Yeah at again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yeah
D :  So
A :  Okay
B :  Product that
D :  I need a product to market
D :  And i just whatever pride you get put together will find a way to market that that i'm not concerned but
A :  It's an area
D :  If you if you give me if you give me a cut out what everybody else has and i need it any define the lower costs
A :  So we'll
A :  Questions here really are
A :  We don't
A :  On a cradle
A :  Do we go basic or do we go for features
A :  And it does anybody really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should be that's that
B :  Well my question is what would the scroll-wheel do
A :  A fine for
B :  Function wise what does that do that
A :  About that was in your presentation so what what would you imagine it being
D :  Yeah what what was it was
B :  Yeah
B :  It's it's just another way to do the exact same thing the the buttons to
A :  Okay
D :  Okay know what i say with a scroll wheel is everybody has buttons
D :  So from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique
D :  If we create something more complex or more expensive
D :  Then i don't know if that makes it a a marketing necessity
D :  But again from marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing is possible because for welcome what is a very competitive market
A :  Quite understand that scroll-wheels of the the quite expensive to
A :  To make
B :  That uh they're gonna be more expensive but
A :  But
B :  And the other hand i mean
B :  I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some ah
B :  You know if the if we're gonna make of the extra cost by you extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to do it but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll-wheel for its channels up and channels down
B :  I don't think value or do you think volume would be
C :  Oh that first of all the menu and
B :  No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but
A :  Oh i'd i like the idea of basically forcing the
A :  Uh my personal preferences forcing the product or one
A :  The idea of the
A :  Uh
A :  "'kay" so they'd be
A :  Uh
A :  Depends it to charge it we can target like environmentally friendly ideas
A :  That's i think it is it makes it
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  Mark it's easy to differentiate of rubber that's a
D :  I think it's
D :  I think so
A :  And if we
A :  It keeps the rest
A :  And the format that is durable
A :  Because the the the whole product gonna need to be more durable that that's because you're not going to be getting it is often it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the week real
A :  So if we can market it in terms of
A :  That and the other
D :  I think we get some exclusivity in that
D :  You know we get something that nobody else has right now and and that means we can we can make some adjustments and the reach a little surprised if we need to it also can create it on demand from its uniqueness
A :  So are big decision then is like how do we do
A :  Um like we have to decide on it it doesn't have to say the on button not exactly the details but do we have
A :  Uh
A :  What state of casing
A :  I personally you were saying about be
A :  Plastic with the rubber
B :  Uh-huh i'm thinking yeah something like can almost like these pens
B :  You know where there is you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like if you used
B :  The plastic with rubber on the outside
A :  Okay is that they sense that she for a a grip so
B :  Well no made yeah maybe a bit more than design here but do it just is it
B :  Kind of an inspiration these pens i think a kind of
A :  Okay
A :  So then
A :  If we didn't do we want to do anything more basic with the a bit more advanced of the user interface in terms of
A :  Do we want to go for
A :  Um buttons or do we want
A :  Yeah for this in the scroll wheel and do we want to go l. c. d.
A :  Do want to do is
A :  They wanted anything else on it
C :  It's all the t. v.
B :  And from from my perspective i think l. c. d. is a mistake
B :  Because
B :  This is a universal remote and all you're doing i mean
B :  It's you're not gonna get any information back from the television so the only information you can display in this remote is
B :  What channel you just sent to that less than this is not a lot of information
B :  You know there
B :  It receives no information
B :  So i i don't see any reason for having an l. c. d. "'cause" it's an increase cost
B :  Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it
D :  Yeah right now is right now there's nothing coming out of the t. v. to receive so
D :  Uh-huh much technology changes and information
D :  So it's coming out of that
D :  A cable box or something those those i don't see that
D :  Um so yeah so so you have an l. c. either
D :  Not too
A :  Okay
A :  So all
A :  The question that i guess we need
A :  Two
A :  This thing about do you guys basically have to label and
A :  It's a good idea till the last thing so what we need to know all in terms of marketing and
A :  Uh project manager an hour
A :  Are there any other questions that we need to answer night before you guys and one bulb s.
A :  For what
A :  Overall things that we not the same dunno
B :  Well we have to i think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what do you know user interface is gonna be lose the scroll wheel in or out
B :  What you guys like in the user interface
A :  Maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make an offer that that seems to justify the cost
D :  I i again
D :  Well i think it's it's
D :  The more unique miss you can bring the the product be easier it is i believe me to market
D :  Uh again the pushbuttons i i c. r. or everywhere
D :  And so we can go with the same thing we're gonna be can competing uh
D :  In a broader market then if we go with something unique
D :  Yeah the other thing i thought about was you know do we do something like this
D :  Make a remote it doesn't look like remote
D :  It's just another it is just a an idea i don't know
B :  Well i don't know about like the flip phone idea
B :  Because
B :  I think
B :  As far as durability it's not
B :  A big
B :  Well
D :  I mean what i say one of the things one other things you brought up in or your presentation is you get children
D :  There's this task it's inside the circuit really get dirty they get messy with drinks and stuff this
D :  And what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this saying look or act or in some way identify itself is unique are different
D :  But you guys are the ones that have to ultimately create a product within cost
A :  Yeah and i guess the the the question that
A :  Uh do you mean actually knows whether
A :  Is the dock
A :  Enough of a unique
A :  Feature to be able to go and sell at a as a as a
A :  A very different from uh
A :  Or do we really need the scroll wheel as well
D :  Well
D :  Two
B :  Yeah
D :  I think yeah they get in the cost effectiveness i think if you can have the base station with the with the locator i think those are two very strong features if that's something that can be integrated with other much of the extra cost
B :  The locator is gonna require a radio transmitter which will
A :  That's gone and this that money that that's a trap as well
B :  Um i will tell you have to go with a like a meeting
B :  Chips i would imagine
B :  But we uh we will need a receiver uh huh
D :  Integrated yeah
D :  So that's just uh
D :  I i think that's
B :  It should be really simple signal so
D :  I know personally that would be a very attractive features to have a
D :  Um have a button i can push to find the remote control
A :  It is and we're gonna need a speaker then uh something like that as well to be
B :  That's true yeah
A :  I guess a little tiny speakers gonna be quite cheap it's not gonna need quality is it is
B :  Oh yeah yeah it'll be really cheap
D :  Or maybe you could like have a uh smell or am i you know you push a button minutes put sense think
A :  But
C :  Yeah
A :  Makes you live in a more fresh
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  Okay with them over time here um we've got another ten minutes
A :  I think that's uh
B :  So the scroll wheel
B :  In or out
A :  And that my personal preferences it
A :  I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more unique spin already have that and i don't think it's all be as natural as it would be used
C :  Yeah i think we have like it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole fine
A :  Mm
D :  Yeah
C :  Is it it breaks down easier
B :  For me i think the scroll-wheel actually may not be so bad i don't know exactly what the increase cost is gonna be bit
B :  I think you guys have a point it
B :  It might push somebody or the edge one they're looking at our
B :  And our remote versus um else when they see this one has a scroll-wheel to go up and down the channels
B :  Think it might be kinda need to
B :  Be able to do it like that
A :  But then that that surely that depends a lot on the t. v. because some t. v.s are quite for changing channels
A :  From obliques all if you've got a scroll been used you have to scroll scroll what really really small week
A :  Just so that you're actually keeping
A :  In case with the t. v.s ability to to change channels are
A :  You have to go through and you wait for it you scroll uh button and the menu if
B :  Well i think what what would be used like like them i'm like this where it's maybe you know a digital
A :  Uh-huh
B :  We oh right where it's where it's contest
B :  Into it you know a certain
D :  Ooh uh
A :  Oh i see see that's yeah
B :  That was that was my
B :  My intuition of a scroll wheel would be
A :  And so you see you're talking about now
A :  Okay
B :  It's just it's basically it's it's just of look-and-feel think it has the same exact functionalities two buttons
D :  I i think is you know that the
D :  There's so many people are they they're they're surfing
D :  Or television servers and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing it's that one button to buy
A :  Yeah if you just centred one
D :  It is indeed you did did did you did did
D :  I've really
A :  Actual actually
D :  I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing
B :  Yeah just just say no though it you did bring up a point which is very valid is all i. t. v.s war the t. v.s will respond exactly the same some of organic at a slow switching see you may like to walk like
B :  Fifteen channel changes in it'll be like flip
B :  Flip
D :  Well that's
A :  Well not necessarily you could basically make it so that at all
A :  I i was just gonna be send a signal to the t. v. yeah the t. v.s that so if you send a bit fight for channels
A :  If you do that it's gonna fight ones
B :  Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can make it goes fast as you want but i think what people get used to it
A :  Other than that
B :  I i do like the idea the scroll wheel
A :  And uh for marketing is the height nice product and we're gonna be selling it to people are buying t. t. v.s as well yeah presumably
D :  Yeah i think so
A :  From our only
D :  I i think so yeah the the only thing i i i'm the interface side of it
D :  Is that i i i see the dilemma
D :  But if we have the option of of scrolling tick tick tick tick it at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct
D :  Okay
D :  So i can go all uh
D :  Presuming i have
D :  On my television something that tells you what channel one one i can scroll directs from channel five to channel thirty two
D :  Shouldn't i know what because it's on a television the television tells me what channel it's on wanna change it so
D :  I i don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a a problem "'cause" a television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the pushable button
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay so can can we can we create a kind of interface within a scroll system image they wanna say
B :  I think i know what you might be getting it
A :  Oh i see so if maybe if we had an l. c. d. of the top they just did a number on it right
D :  Television
B :  What about this what about if you can program in your favourite channels
B :  Into the the scroll wheel and you can
B :  Just like roll through your favourite channels
A :  That's quite cool you'd need a display and they
A :  Do you think
B :  Why it'll tell you when you flip the channel that
D :  Is it the television can tell you
D :  Yeah
A :  Oh yeah and i see the itself but yeah that's kinda cool either you program it though
B :  Oh it is it's one extra button you say
B :  Programme start and then type in "'cause" you still have the typing you know you still have a keypad we can take them in any way so program start zero one enter
B :  Zero five enter and thirty eight enter
B :  Programme and
D :  And then
A :  Okay and yeah not just basically flights between uh and although it sends a zero five and then thirty six and then
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So you wanna get ask an actual like that
D :  Then again we have another another great marketing tool
D :  We have about three
A :  It's expensive because that's gonna be
A :  You gonna be able to not all for computer mouse manufacturers really
B :  Uh-huh
A :  You'd basically come up with the partnership to be able to produce that great cheaply
D :  I don't know and then maybe we maybe even have this as in half technology that's maybe something it's available through our own uh
D :  Round services
A :  Maybe
A :  But that that's not gonna be such a costly feature the problem we're gonna have is making it would last
B :  Uh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes between going through your favourites list
A :  Making it last
B :  And just paying up one up to
D :  We go directional
A :  So if there's a button
D :  We go this we do this we go this way for one we go this way for the other
B :  Um because you wanna be able to go up and down to the channel
A :  Yeah people are
A :  Rates are uh whether they do that or are they
D :  Well then you just have you have and if you have a mode
A :  Yeah you have a much that
B :  Well new remotes which but then if we have a morse which we're gonna need some kinda indicator
A :  Still white then the buttons to like what buttons bit
B :  Two weeks
B :  In a light in l. e. d.
B :  Okay
A :  Is that what
C :  Yeah well the yeah
A :  Oh that
A :  Okay we have five minutes so rate details that that we've talked about here
A :  Are they want a scroll wheel
A :  We want
A :  Um would indicate uh
A :  We want
A :  What buttons
A :  And information back flat buttons p. d. a. do we wanna just for the more than the kids are maybe to indicate what button you press in at the time so the you know fits actually preston not seen some remotes do that
B :  Okay just so you know i think i mean it was minus ten the the four we're gonna stay in the mid market range it seems are kind of approaching
B :  Higher end range i wanna make sure everybody's okay with that
D :  Yeah
A :  I think we are yeah
D :  Are you ready now i'd say we have more money for those
A :  Yeah well we don't have the the thing
A :  It's not that we have more money we can push up the the price
D :  That's the main we can increase the cost
B :  Okay
D :  So i don't know i don't know whether have a
B :  I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with that
A :  Yeah
A :  So we really need to be sure rest of what we can push the cost up to the we haven't got the speech we're ready to and then the price of components
A :  That's it was our price to be looking to sell something like that and what's our price can we make it for
D :  Well i think i think the design in technology has to come back and say o. k. a. to create this product we see is gonna cost is this much for this volume because we do have uh volume target of of fifty me a profit
A :  Yeah i'm not as i think that's we really should be more flexible there anything else because if we said in the last meeting
A :  Um i didn't really looking first for sure brand
A :  We're entering a new market here so i think they
A :  Excitation for this one product is maybe not
A :  As important as being able to
D :  Okay i'm i'm okay with that i guess what i just want to me the next at this for these guys to come come in with the design proposal where the cost estimate attached
D :  And then we have to take this to the next level
A :  What's the ballpark rest of what would be able to sell something like that
B :  Well yeah let's let's try
D :  We had to find cost
B :  Much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store in your in the market to replace your t. v. remote
B :  How much you you pay for that
A :  But you're the thing to target market is because i i'm not our target market i'm a student
B :  I'm just asking you
B :  If
A :  On the other hand
A :  I would think
A :  Hmmm with my project manager salary
B :  Probably for it
A :  Yeah i could probably afford this uh it would have that
A :  Maybe if i had it on your t. v. images are we can really fly can i had the talk to have the scroll wheel which i think to really cool idea that with some an awful
A :  Then maybe
A :  You know i i don't think edible over a hundred euros certainly that would be way too much but they
B :  Or no no
A :  I'd be happy being over forty four i guess
B :  I would say thirty five to forty
A :  But not much
D :  Yeah i was gonna say thirty five to fifty
A :  "'kay" thirty five to fifty years is a silver okay
D :  What is it one other thing for marketing about this product is is this is the last one you ever need to by your television that one of the marketing features in this
A :  As soon as well
B :  Right
A :  That's why the scroll needs to be really the last
C :  Okay so we'll come up with some to be to thirty five and fifty that is
