A :  Okay good afternoon
A :  Hope you have a good lunch
C :  Oh
C :  Yeah they have a lot of
A :  Oh but it's
A :  Can you
B :  Uh yes i had something some more
B :  Non vegetarian
A :  Okay so today is um
A :  I were third meeting
A :  That would be about the conceptual design
A :  Uh
A :  If i come back to um the minutes of the last meetings
A :  Um
A :  We decided not to go for speech recognition technology so
A :  Because of some reasons and all honesty say that about to the use of the g. d. screen on the
A :  On the remote control because of costs
A :  So maybe we can would be able to clarify this this question today
A :  Uh the in the meeting we should
A :  Take a decision on that point
A :  So hopefully that story speak if presentations
A :  Uh we had that's
A :  So
A :  Each of you have some presentations presentation too
A :  The form
A :  Um we'll start
D :  Okay ways to
A :  Some marketing
D :  Mm
A :  So you are you save d. or in the presentation somewhere
A :  So you for
D :  Four yeah
A :  Which is very much
A :  Okay used the marketing expert
D :  Yeah that's me
A :  So far
D :  The
D :  Well aim is to get the difference
D :  More that
D :  A mystery ed d. player the process of the users
D :  Uh so they yeah
D :  The car investigation on the outside a cat and
D :  Then
D :  Current events
D :  Yeah okay
D :  That and so
D :  Okay
D :  What what what i've found
D :  When are you
A :  It's like
D :  What a felony know there are of importance
D :  From leicester more important is that
D :  People want an easy to use device
D :  After they they want something
D :  Neil did not is it technologically speaking
D :  By uh the most
D :  What they
D :  What they find more
D :  Morning testing more more importantly it's a a fancy look-and-feel instead of a instead of the car and
D :  The car and train which was
D :  For the functional look and feel so old now
D :  More
D :  More core aspect not more high court that aspect uh rather than a device which many phones times on many buttons with
D :  Instead of you is that the hot out of a device which can do all many things
D :  I've your eyes which use
D :  Pleasant to to watch
D :  To see
D :  Uh i still
D :  Well in in your teen
D :  In the eighties and he back
D :  This
D :  In that is i'm in that is and need and they they kind and then all of
D :  Feature a rough loads for the tools and uh this
D :  Oh this fascinates
D :  It's fruit and they uh this this thing is free time this it was
D :  And uh so um in a in the u. s. a. they they got trend them all the most popular
D :  Feeling it's is a spongy
D :  Spongy means people easy
D :  So maybe we should
D :  We still
D :  I think in in design action john
B :  What what do you mean by
B :  Fruit and vegetable and spongy
B :  What you mean close
C :  Spongy means that it's like
D :  Three days it was is the in the in new long have you seen the last
D :  Yes but ease of close knit and
B :  No i missed that one
D :  Yeah i i again nice and
D :  I i them is and i saw that the fruit it's the i mean if pictures of freedom is it or seen the
B :  Are they okay so they're not like the rest of the carrot they decide now
D :  It's not not not not yet
B :  As a fruit on
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay
B :  So what i gather
D :  So it'll actually
B :  Well the shape of them
B :  Banana just
D :  Yeah
B :  Maybe
D :  Visit teletext as an artist and
A :  Drawings off and it's
B :  Okay and
D :  Yeah i yeah
C :  But what's the solution whole we can have some cheap like that on the
A :  Well cell disease in the next like something
D :  They're not no it's not uh-huh
A :  It's not
B :  So which fruit are you thinking of
D :  And
D :  Hmm
D :  Now that
D :  I had i haven't thought of any particular fruit bat
D :  The agenda at aspect of a of the remote control mm
D :  Maybe
D :  Many colours we mind
D :  Some kind of visitor or some kind of
D :  Instead of visitor what are some natural and uh uh and not to know all of that or something
D :  Bad yeah it it it depends on the
A :  Maybe you maybe you can display and then and then let's see
B :  But the you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or
B :  You want to some kind of like fruit logo on uh
C :  Means buttons are in this
D :  Yeah maybe they say it's this eight
C :  But inside and the fruit shape of fruits or something
C :  Upload banana have something like that
D :  Not not
D :  Mm
A :  People for channel one
D :  Not not too much for those not too much folk or not
D :  Not that's not the same it out of fruit because nancy yeah that that the team that that would be different
D :  So we shouldn't be at work and really at act
D :  Two
D :  To that stands out
B :  Say something that looks off like refer to have like an elf
D :  For instance yeah
D :  I think out as an uh huh
C :  That we can discuss that right
B :  Like yeah i know
B :  I'm not really sure
B :  If uh that would really appeal to everyone then maybe just a fashion gurus
B :  Like
B :  Maybe just like a little bit and a little fruit peaches somewhere in the corner but i don't know about uh
B :  And the hat economic uh and oranges
D :  One that maybe we
D :  Which is that is specifying
D :  What does it
D :  Either we for losing
D :  I think
D :  In my opinion we should for goes on on young people
D :  Because they are more all parental
D :  Newly like new devices and
D :  Oh so yeah i i got into a marketing people or nineteen ninety five percent of young people are worse
D :  I was
D :  Was able to
D :  To buy yeah
D :  And need a corner
D :  Remote control
B :  But is it is for cool
A :  Uh the question
B :  It's fruit cool
D :  Is the new ten
D :  Of the
B :  Well i guess you know apple
B :  As the ipods uh
B :  In much
B :  Just "'cause" they have an apple and uh
B :  On the product is something for to school
D :  No i think we we should think about that i shape with it
D :  I device with the shape of some
B :  Okay but has to be easy to
B :  To use uh and the whole thing uh
B :  You know on a pear or uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Well known
D :  They do you think we can find that the shape of a fruit which is sandy
B :  Well probably the only thing is a banana can think of a cucumber
D :  Two years
C :  Banana
D :  Well
B :  Um
A :  Maybe to look
B :  Maybe
B :  To great
D :  Maybe
B :  So it but i mean you also have to yes also have fit all the buttons and you uh
B :  That's it
D :  Yeah
B :  The thing is you have to normally with um
B :  With buttons i have to be at some point it has to circuit board so you can have things like are on a cylindrical kind of device that may be difficult to kind of
B :  The bill
C :  And it would be rolling oh right
D :  I i like you know yeah
D :  We should have
D :  A lot of buttons
A :  Yeah and you you you would not have they enough of the face to put their c. d. on the banana
D :  Uh well done so
B :  Yeah
D :  How do you wanna nicely with twenty five euros
A :  You're the marketing expert
A :  You should tell us if it's too much not
D :  I think
D :  Well uh i've got into the yeah to a beep or people are more the devastating
D :  Not fat a fancy look and feel down in the technology gonna
D :  In know in
D :  Innovation so
D :  I will give more importance to they look and feel down right and they
A :  So you you use it
D :  New input and that so it's
D :  I'm not convinced about these s. c. t. v. "'cause" you need uh internet connection and you need more thing is is not gest buying an eel control of the remote you do need my income for a remote buying uh
D :  More things it's not so simple
A :  So you'll see it
A :  You lost it you know things to
A :  The remote control that looks like a banana
D :  For instance yeah
A :  Few buttons
D :  Yeah for for it for you then i an example yeah
A :  With only a few buttons
A :  So maybe you can do it
D :  Yeah not it's what they are they said
A :  Okay
A :  Thanks
A :  Um
A :  Okay i give the floor
A :  So you are user interface guy
B :  Okay
A :  So you
A :  Three
B :  Yeah
A :  And it's this one
A :  The fact that
B :  Okay so
B :  Next uh huh
B :  Okay so i received an email
B :  Um
B :  And lunchtime
B :  They know that the bring in mind to the technology division has developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
B :  Um
B :  Which is a way if you'd have a conversation with the coffee machine
B :  And all remote control
C :  It's just a speaker like
B :  It's know what it is it's it's it's very
C :  It's not a microphone
B :  It has uh has my friends as big as going chip and the less used
C :  Actually i'm not reading microphone that so that's when you cannot happen is that it is just as big deal
B :  Well as the sample
B :  Sensor sample speaker
B :  Sample sensor sample speaker
B :  It means that you can recognise it can be like a match on uh on a certain phrase that you speak
B :  And then can play back
B :  Phrase in response to that
B :  But uh at this know a kind of um
B :  Understanding of the phrase
C :  Okay
B :  So i i mean you know i guess you could build i mean you could you could link the the recognition on a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control
C :  Uh-huh
B :  But basically the thing is we have this technology available
C :  In arms
B :  In house so
B :  Um but the thing is obviously they're still gonna be a cost
B :  If you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for that
B :  Production components uh
B :  Um it's it
B :  But basically means we we can kind of consider this from our
B :  You know a theoretical usability committee point without worrying too much about you know how to develop that because we have this already done
B :  "'cause" you know some people might get annoying if we uh
B :  If we just dump at all
A :  But it's something that i
A :  And yeah it really in this thing
A :  Is is a technology that we can nice
A :  Keywords speech kuwait
B :  It's it's
B :  It's not well it's a real recognise uh
B :  I guess he was but you know he was in a set not like a freight you train it for a certain uh
B :  For a certain phrase you say
B :  The the example they said that they have uh up and running with the prototype is um
B :  Well but actually integrated that into the the coffee machine that uh
B :  That would producing is you can say good morning
B :  Coffee machine me to recognise that for it and it'll play back
B :  Good morning
A :  Yeah just a
B :  How would you like a coffee
A :  And just to play back something
B :  Yeah so actually that was bad example doesn't actually a sky anyway of it because you can't really understand of course
A :  Yeah yeah so that's not
A :  Israeli to do
A :  To to do
A :  Control
B :  Only like i mean the sense that you can recognise a set
B :  I said target kind of what and
A :  This is just a mall like good point
B :  It's designed it design as a fun kind of thing that i guess you could use it as uh as it
A :  But is it yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Wait it in point uh
A :  So if if you if you said that the t. v. at uh the fancy thing that's true you can bring to we can bring to the remote control
D :  Yeah right
D :  You can you
A :  That we not
A :  Have any
B :  Completely pointless yeah
A :  Yeah not completely pointless
A :  For the in the fall from the interaction on the on the u. n. isn't it
B :  Yeah and as you know and you live in conversation with your remote control
A :  Okay
D :  Yeah but that
D :  Can we use it for so yeah okay ten or fifteen deadline
B :  Well yeah that's the thing if
B :  You can but you have to pray you do it i think is a fairly simple design so you'd have to record into the device
B :  Every possible combination yeah just
B :  Train it's not the law and channel fifteen and whole thing not just a watch channel and the way it fifteen doesn't have that kind of logic in it
A :  Yeah
A :  So is it
A :  So he's this is much more than be taking this technology we need to the remote control
B :  Is that
B :  Yeah that would be some development
A :  And using it
A :  It's all this is
A :  Couple of discussion
A :  So if you see if it is something that you can we can bring easily it to put it into the bat and a remote control
D :  My my no
B :  I dunno no no no
A :  That is that
D :  Dynamite oh yeah
A :  Uh f. then
A :  You could be cool yeah
C :  Okay that's great
B :  I uh i i i don't think it's worth but i think it doesn't really add much to the functional
B :  Design and it's it's it's not mature enough
B :  To use as a speech recognition engines uh
A :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  Yes i think it's we want the next slide at this time of course more couple of uh
B :  Uh some of the features of that
B :  Into a funky looking yeah
A :  It doesn't look like a banana apple
B :  Remote control
B :  Well you see all those i was unaware at this point of of the fruit for kids
A :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  So the mothers more of a box like this
D :  Looks like it
D :  Little less that
A :  You see now you can't
D :  I got a topic of fruit
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah well this is x. this could be genetically engineered for it is designed to be yeah square so that it pack start it in the boxes
B :  But um i just indicate he would never actually two scroll-wheels because i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um
C :  It's doable thing and that's right
B :  Keep out of you know
B :  I think in one of us agree that that that it could be quite a useful well um
C :  That was easy use it is
B :  Things uh
B :  But i think it's important you know to have two scroll-wheels because
B :  You know you want one for for the channel we also want one for for the volume because it's it's
A :  Uh-huh
B :  The volume is it's you know it's very handy for it to have the instant kind of uh uh feedback or in response ah
B :  But um also include this to a button but going tonight
B :  Every design should have at a button
D :  What's of the remote
B :  Well it's it's as you know a unique problem with with television's is that if you have this got this scroll-wheel for the television
B :  The uh but you know and the t. v. "'s" not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can
B :  Scroll
B :  So you know the the the person might want to have a uh
B :  Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without
B :  Seeing what's on them
B :  Which guess it just waiting to use top
B :  Scrolling and then you know just ways that station
B :  Well i might want to
B :  Scroll and and have a quick glimpse all that even if it lights behind what they're doing that
D :  Can you can close the speech
B :  Yeah so with the solar button you can say skip i have a
B :  Channels if uh
B :  You know if i'm if i'm going from scrolling possible
B :  In you know it's um
B :  You could have a little red light that comes up and i press that so they feeling uh it's really going fast or whatever
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So are yeah that's uh um there's a two important to our features i think
B :  Me on the right but i mean we can discuss about what other
B :  Kind of buttons we need um
B :  You might you could be you know it if we if we wanna have like a very cheap
B :  Kind of device i mean we could even consider that made we want to
B :  Still this is a very if it's gonna be a banana you know as a pretty gimmicky kind of
B :  Think that doesn't have that much functionality is just you know a couple scroll-wheels not button "'cause" it's hard to get so many buttons on the
A :  It's enough
B :  Banana and it's still very you may even be from mice for some people more functional and then carmine but if they have these scroll-wheels uh
B :  Um
B :  You know what other buttons we want
B :  I mean we could have one because you need an on off switch way you could you could that you could turn out to our um our technical of the banana but
A :  So shall yeah
B :  Yeah it's kind of
B :  Like a spy can afford thing
D :  So it's crazy i like user yes
B :  I
B :  That's why you're our marketing here
A :  Okay
D :  Yeah
A :  Slide well going completely to forget about basic thing
B :  Well that's the thing is um we decided that we can and spend uh
B :  Twenty-five euro
A :  I think that
B :  Well not spend but you know catch on fire yeah
D :  Right i think we would use
D :  Some call there
D :  So coffee machine they about interface uh huh
A :  Now we can that can choose acts
D :  We can we kind
A :  We can't use that to
C :  Commentator
A :  To command could communicate is just to feed
D :  Yeah but we can say ten or twenty five
C :  It's one right
D :  No
B :  But then you have to have a template every channel four hundred channels you have to be a tool to recognise
D :  It's not a lot one of the templates so
B :  Well i
B :  I think it's probably more than than that you can handle "'cause" is designed for a coffee machine you notice a hell are in the morning
D :  I see soundtrack
D :  Okay
D :  Is it designed for a coffee machine
B :  Well that's that's card application i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design of the hand a hundred things
D :  Okay
D :  Yeah
B :  So uh
D :  Maybe you could actually oh
D :  You could have the engineering department
A :  Yeah but but but a good thing you want to to move feels slides yeah finish
D :  If we uh
C :  Yeah that's right yeah
B :  Well i this and this may be fine i don't i don't know if that speech recognition is you know even if we can do it i think it's not really appropriate for uh
A :  Yeah i think so
B :  Television and running
B :  But um i did have one thing from a previous meeting you were talking about um
D :  Oh yeah
B :  Being able to find of
B :  The remote control
B :  And also to that extent it be a text in the remote control what having an uh a base station acting control of things as well
A :  Uh-huh
B :  It might be useful to have
B :  Some kind of base station even if it's just you press that button on that and uh
B :  And the remote control starts beeping you know this is a way of finding
B :  The remote
B :  In that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing to be useful just to say i'm here
A :  Okay
A :  Exactly yeah
B :  But uh
B :  It's probably the the kill if you could just have a
C :  So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing
B :  A beating
C :  Something in the store they just open up
B :  It's the it's
B :  It's speech since the since it's speech kind of not really speech recognition that kind of button
C :  That's right
B :  Okay
A :  Well the lady
A :  Okay
A :  Okay let's move on
A :  So we want to
C :  That's right
A :  Okay
C :  So this is going to be about the component design
A :  Uh-huh
C :  So first thing is we need power source
C :  For the remote controls all
C :  I was all the idea that we can have to kind of power supply is one is that you should batteries which uh that they could be chargeable batteries if there's a base station kind of thing
C :  And on top of that we can have solar cells and the lighting conditions are good that can be used so
C :  It'd be pretty
C :  Uh in a week of kind
C :  Then now we need plastic with some elasticity so that if you're
C :  Of the remote control or false
C :  It's from broken broken into pieces they should be some flexibility
B :  I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah so
C :  They should we should
C :  I think or something like that and then
C :  It should be double curve
C :  That's the states
C :  Well the ease of handling and
C :  There's some other issues like we need the book oh
C :  Then controls for the traditionals use traditional uses we can have the pushbuttons so that they don't feel that it's in the in thing for them
B :  But this one's like when you say double curve
B :  But if we menu and you could
B :  Like drawer so thing and uh
B :  On the whiteboard though
C :  The look of as you have "'cause" on both the sides if i'm right
C :  So it symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is
B :  Okay but like
B :  And convex okay
C :  It could be cold
C :  So it could be convex can be concave
C :  Depending on what what people want
A :  Hmm
B :  Okay
C :  So there are flights there a single curve and they're double go so these are the three things and they are different ideas that plastic
C :  You can have the book oh but the the side not the materials we cannot that the book oh
C :  So there there was a there were many other materials like wood
C :  Did i mean um and all those things but
C :  Plastic as a thing is that most appropriate one
C :  It'll ring the cost down
C :  And then it's
B :  Although you know would it
B :  Could be a
B :  Quite a stylish uh
B :  Option if you take like
B :  Nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grinding you kind of put some
A :  Mm hm
B :  Sometimes uh
A :  But there is no elasticity
A :  Which were could be
C :  What in cases
B :  Well it depends i mean you have the outs the wood itself was not gonna break so you'd have to worry too much about the case been broken is the inside yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning
A :  Yeah but the components inside
B :  That's not visible to the to the user
A :  Hmm
A :  Maybe too expensive to do
B :  I mean you could also it
A :  And also i
B :  You can adjust a very thin veneer of wood as well
A :  Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana and plastic then then it would
B :  That's true
B :  But i we said on the banana
B :  Idea
D :  Actually
A :  Slide show
D :  I was thinking that the
A :  Oh i getting
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Disable for one and i it's not
D :  It's not very handy
A :  That's it
D :  I don't know the name like in english uh
C :  Is it and you have
D :  This is not afraid it's uh there's a door
B :  It's like a pumpkin off
A :  Yeah
A :  And can
D :  Green
B :  Right
A :  And green um no um
A :  Um yes i see
B :  What does it taste like
D :  And you put in this at
A :  It be doing
B :  Uh yes it was that in french
A :  Cool
D :  This is our
B :  Yeah okay
B :  So i kept them all at all
A :  Uh but uh
D :  But uh
A :  But um the the
D :  I do a set it that's a switch with the double
D :  You are for is you have
B :  I dunno it seems a little bit kind of all pleased to me
D :  No i mean in our
A :  Is not really in the
B :  Oh no no you can have
A :  Missing israeli fancy and fun
A :  Using is that uh young people
D :  I'm sure it's fine
A :  More than abandon
D :  But banana is not so handy
D :  I think that's fine yeah
C :  More handy a risk um but at the same thing and
C :  To get to come
B :  But then yeah i like a banana you can you can you hold it like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and it's
A :  Yeah
B :  Roll back and forth like that but with the
A :  It's kind of
A :  It's more
B :  I don't know how you wanna hold a cap sit down and
A :  It's very i'm gonna need it fits in the hand um
A :  Yeah the most also face to
A :  The for the controls
D :  Yeah alright
A :  So studies running a smaller
C :  Okay so pushbuttons well the traditional users so that they don't feel the and i needed
C :  Just
C :  And a scroll button but push technology for channel selection volume control and they need exposing
C :  These are the three scroll buttons which are already available but that's
C :  And the company and we we can go ahead with that
A :  Okay
C :  Yeah we can go to the next thing
C :  Then now they're different kind of chips one
C :  One is the basic chip and then regular chip in banana that advanced chip
C :  So we can have regular chip all control rising is a factor for us that's why we go for the regular chip
C :  And a regular chip supports speaker support
C :  So this functionality could be used for
C :  It's in the
C :  Mobile phone which is the misplace
B :  So is that when you say it's because of what you mean it just has an apple print which which
B :  Which kind of
C :  It could be a beep kind of thing
B :  Okay but the speakers actually attached to the to the chip in some way or is it just the the signal
C :  Yes yes that's right it's it's on to the chip
C :  Most
C :  Most probably
C :  Not not hundred percent sure about
B :  So any issues so where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the
B :  Just take it from the outside of the banana
C :  Then we the old one in control a thing which which a user
C :  It it should be already predefined
C :  It should be in one would be that is the chip a lot is going to be sitting inside
B :  Yeah but the speaker is the speaker is actually on the chip
B :  Then if it's too far away from a the casing was the casing is to say then you may not hear the
C :  Oh so we can have a good one of the won't be so that
B :  The speaker
C :  I think that's a key better
B :  Yeah
C :  As far as the hearing is concerned are we can have some gap at some place
B :  Yeah that's um we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design as to keep the
C :  So that's a
C :  That's right
B :  The speaker personal that's uh
C :  Okay yeah
C :  So these these were the component selection in these things we can go to the next slide
A :  Oh
C :  And the these were the findings which i i
C :  It's all that bad bad
C :  They'd user wants to help control more than one device want to control more than one device from the same remote control
C :  Still
C :  Oh what you mean what can happen at the extra things to support additional devices like b. c. i. d. v. d. players which are usually a touch with the t. v.
C :  Because users out like this then they don't want to have one remote control for everything so
B :  Although it is
C :  Additional it will be might be having slightly better market for us
B :  Depends if we wait um if we are concentrating on like a fruit
B :  Design a member a maybe we wanna so what collection
B :  Oh for it yeah but a different fruit for each device
C :  Fruits
B :  Is that you know that
B :  Sometimes people like to collect
B :  Um
C :  Remotes
A :  Objects
B :  You know things that it all those are more uh
C :  Objects okay
A :  Crazy okay
D :  I think that'll be fine and the beginning bad after one month
D :  You read that it off
D :  The surrounded of fruits
B :  Well you have a new one at the data for it
D :  No but i think that one free to control everything
B :  The power for it
D :  A powerful are powered by a man though it's a button on the fruit
C :  And uh
C :  As well i could see on the the the scroll-button is becoming really uh
C :  What thing
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah
C :  And we should have it on the remote
D :  So i i understand that the way they just two days speak uh lost control
C :  So you're having a base station
C :  Okay
C :  You're usually all remotes it's on that
C :  So you and it's that's right can have chargeable batteries
C :  No let's say
D :  So do you have to bite the things that by nine that and the base station
A :  Is it sends it
C :  This is station is with the thing
A :  It was thing is you you bowled awarding
C :  It's like a telephone handset is there and
C :  The base a station for the telephone handset is there
C :  So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries that rechargeable batteries so all the period of car
C :  Thank you to cut the cost
C :  So you're having the base decision and there is a button if you press that button
C :  There are that are more to to start beeping
C :  So you know with the remote is
B :  I think it's a pretty handy feature
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  I think it's kind of people would find out what's it even if it wasn't uh
B :  A recharging
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Station even if they didn't have to buy for batteries you know
C :  Uh-huh uh-huh
D :  Yeah that i'm a bit worried about the budget
C :  Well this is
C :  A suspicion there's nothing more just it's a
C :  By which is coming from the main cable
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And uh you are having one
C :  Socket on which the things it
B :  Although you do need to include r. f. kind of
C :  That's right
B :  Circuitry in the remote
C :  But all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems
C :  So component costs is going to be the least
C :  Anyway we are not using maybe advanced technology l. c. d. has already been ruled out is that has been ruled out
C :  So it's the basic thing
C :  But really trendy
C :  And maybe user
C :  Friendly
C :  And
B :  I'm just wondering actually
B :  "'cause" you know i this all fruit thing with the banana it's um
B :  It's saying like if that seems a bit kind of uh
B :  Nice like an e. a few people would really wanna banana but what if it was kind of a a stylised or not uh you know rather than having it
B :  Kind of you know a yellow one really looking zachary like a banana could make it kind of so well
B :  And um you know to give you kind of
B :  The idea of a banana but without looking you know
B :  Completely
B :  Teach
B :  The better
B :  One of the little uh you know
A :  If you get your little sketch
B :  Well you know uh at it
B :  I dunno handy
A :  To make something that looks like a banana if you could have the colour of a banana
D :  No i i
C :  Yeah the ways of doing this means uh you don't get
B :  Well they
A :  Uh otherwise
D :  Maybe a little like that
C :  Any feeling that
C :  It's neither it in an an r. r.
B :  This colour
B :  Maybe
B :  You know maybe like still in the shape of a banana
A :  Roughly
B :  No exactly
A :  Who
B :  Exactly
B :  Um but you know i just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture the banana and this kind of
B :  You know
B :  "'cause" the thing is is gonna be a little bit difficult to make
B :  Um
B :  Steve like the texture of an hour anyway and take to have exact shape
B :  I think if you cannot be out the door probably you may as well do it in a style as way that just looks a bit more kind of
B :  You know twenty first century round
A :  Yeah
B :  Sixties and seventies
A :  Okay
C :  And uh
A :  Let's move on that
C :  I mean to the last line
A :  Yeah default be forced
A :  The findings a meeting i like to to draw some sketch about the costs future part of that
A :  Perfect
C :  Okay
A :  Well known that that you you can finish your slides
C :  Okay so anyway users would be so the findings is uses would be really interested in a look at any way to find them the space remotes
A :  Okay
C :  So that was really ipod it's already sufficient but everybody
C :  That
A :  The top it's okay so um
A :  So well on for the presentations so we need to
A :  Takes and it decisions
A :  About um
A :  About for for going to do so i i propose that you go to the whiteboard
B :  Yeah
A :  And
A :  Well going to reports
A :  Well the ideas we had we had doing this
A :  These presentations just to draw some sketch about so which would be the pro the final product
A :  And that were strip a mango banana
A :  And the uh the um the we the basis
C :  Yes
A :  A extra for the functionality is such as a wheels
A :  Um the speaker you need so um well
A :  But in all the the two most of um
A :  The device and the government you call it
C :  That's right the basis station
A :  Base station yeah
A :  Yeah so warm
A :  So
A :  Well going for stylish
A :  Bad attache
B :  Yeah so uh i guess
B :  You wanna hold like the way you the end of the banana you want to have
B :  Holders may you may be one of the whole like a gun know um
B :  "'cause" you don't have to point kind of toward the fall
A :  Yeah right
B :  So it
B :  Yeah so if you have like
D :  What about what all this state
D :  Well if
A :  Well
C :  There's less space on this to put the buttons
A :  If you if you guys are
D :  Yeah but
A :  Over that you could it
A :  The the starting is good but you could you should have more the shape of banana if you want to point really yeah
A :  I just think if you don't want to to to do that that movement which is
A :  Which is difficult
A :  If you don't have to do it in fact it's better
C :  Or or what
A :  So that they need training we have to work to do was to go to move forward
A :  So
A :  Let's keep two of these uh these these uh these i. d.
B :  Okay sir
A :  So we have this we have a a basis so am i recalling really
C :  The base station
A :  The base station or whatever base station extra
A :  Uh on the side
B :  Okay so i guess we need
B :  You know something that can
B :  Fit a banana
B :  Shaped object
C :  Uh-huh yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Uh we have a
A :  Alright
A :  For um
A :  For a beeping
C :  That's right yeah we need i've yeah
A :  Probably being we need a rest to beep

A :  Good
B :  And uh
A :  Noisy
A :  Okay great
B :  Possibly
A :  Um
A :  Very good
C :  Okay
B :  Or we need we need a power um
B :  On off switch as well
A :  Yeah uh
C :  Um for the remote
B :  Yeah
A :  But just as well
C :  Remotes do not have or or
A :  Well for the t. v. for the t. v.
C :  Okay
A :  But so you
C :  But not that'll be fine for by that
C :  Those buttons all be there already yeah
B :  Where
C :  Means on the remote
A :  On the side
C :  As a remote is going to have what they interfaces scroll as well as button it's
C :  Yeah not going to cost too much
C :  Everything is in house and now you don't want the traditional uses to be
C :  At the hands of all this
B :  Well i don't know if if you use the user's gonna buy a
B :  A banana remote
C :  All oh yeah
B :  In the first place you know
C :  That's that's another issue which i didn't think of

C :  But you know like a that's a very high
C :  Means fifty million
