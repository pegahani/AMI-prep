A :  Okay
A :  Uh
A :  I guess that was the test to see if this
A :  Equipment so where it
A :  Mm let's move on to the next but it's
A :  Uh huh project finance selling price twenty five euros
A :  For a name
A :  Fifty million euros
D :  Like an internationally
D :  Sold
A :  Yeah
A :  Production costs are it is kind of
D :  Alright "'kay"
A :  Car cost any more than twelve fifty to make
A :  Mm
A :  Those experience with
A :  With remote control
A :  So i talk about it
A :  We've used well
A :  Yeah it is
A :  Stuff like that
A :  Next meeting starts in thirty minutes
A :  Hi coast twelve
A :  Mm
C :  So i think before we close the were expected uh in the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer or whatever
C :  What ideas where i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah i think we're doing before we close the meeting was supposed to come up with some ideas for
A :  Argh so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion i right now we are
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Oh okay
A :  I thought this was just a
A :  Goodness
A :  Instructions for the right to do next but
C :  Yeah i think this is just the preliminary get some rough ideas for
C :  What our experiences with remote controls and then and what we would
C :  Roughly what we would incorporate into anyone maybe
A :  Okay
A :  Right it on experiences with remote controls and
A :  Pretty much everybody
B :  Uh it yeah
C :  Yeah i think we've all that
D :  Okay
A :  Um
B :  Is this at t. v. one i suppose to make
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah it's t. v. remote control
B :  Okay
A :  Okay um
D :  And new remote control for t. v.
D :  What would i like
A :  What
D :  Um
A :  But they do you wanna small
D :  Medium
A :  We are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we go for something else
A :  There's began
C :  Uh it seems like there's like there's sort of uh
C :  Tension between two ideas i mean you want
C :  We want one remote that maybe to work uh all all the functions of t. v. and if you have
C :  Whatever associated with the t. v. the t. v. d. player or something like that
A :  You video and
A :  Hi find stuff
C :  But but at the same time you don't wanna really busy
C :  Remote with
C :  A thousand buttons on it or something
A :  Maybe you yeah i know that
A :  As the other thing is it's gonna be cheap
C :  Yeah
A :  "'cause" our our we know saying in
A :  Something that's got different but maybe at at
A :  An l. c. d. display on it that
A :  Different pages for different
A :  Devices
D :  Uh-huh
A :  But that would that would probably be quite expensive
B :  But how do we knew how much
B :  Uh
B :  I mean
B :  How much do we have poor
B :  How much
D :  Twelve fifty
B :  Oh
C :  You get can be more than twelve fifty per unit
D :  We should
A :  Per unit yeah
C :  Cost
B :  So do we have to be realistic within the budget or
A :  Well the moment week to uh remote "'cause" we this about with the what we do in a remote is just saying what what we'd like and then after we want to find what we can like some different ideas
B :  I don't know how much it costs yeah
A :  We can end and do research to find out if these any of these ideas or feasible or not
A :  So the be nice to have something that that controls
A :  Lots of different things
C :  Yeah
A :  Um
D :  Then we have like
D :  One that comes out
D :  Like see have one in like
B :  Yeah
D :  No it doesn't have to be really thick every remote controls can be with the minutes to an end
D :  You have one few d. v. d. in this slide that then you have another one slider that
D :  Sarah slides and then the call comes compact
A :  Okay
A :  Okay that's an eye
D :  Into one so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together by making them thinner
D :  And um into one basically
A :  That's an idea
C :  Yeah
D :  So you just for them out
B :  Um
A :  Okay
B :  Well
B :  Have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the t. v. d. and b. c. or excess and stuff
B :  And then on the of the sign what one uh remote control that would be very very simple was just the channel program plus and minus and then just the mute button for example i can we keep it really really simple one side and the other side be very complicated
A :  One side kids one side for adults
C :  I'm not sure if it's like
B :  Oh grandmother well you know like it but it's the mute button
C :  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote that "'cause" it would be very
C :  Hard to use in the way that you but then you can do that
B :  No but you would slide didn't see uh some of like something on the back would hold like to wouldn't be able to press the buttons but
C :  Yeah
C :  Ah okay
A :  Like a whole lot or something like that flip telephone something that that maybe
C :  Okay
D :  That'd be cool
D :  I was thinking that
A :  Flip it open and you got all the buttons or you flip it closing you just got there
A :  Basic buttons on the outside maybe
A :  Um well we got five minutes left
B :  Stalled trade you know
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
D :  Um
A :  Well we've got we've got a few ideas uh
C :  Yeah we should
D :  That's yeah
C :  But i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least uh
C :  A rough conceptual it was stage one was
C :  Technical functions design what affect the apparatus should have
C :  Okay um
C :  So we we start time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface
C :  But the the functions that were sure that we want our that it can
C :  Control the t. v. but also devices connected to the
C :  To the t. v. you mean
A :  Yeah
C :  Be able to operate
C :  D. v. d. players
C :  Things like that
A :  I have got i think we should also have a backup plan of i "'cause" i i just think that might be expensive to make something that i mean we don't we have been told has to be something that all control everything
C :  Yeah
A :  We should have a backup plan or just a a really good television remote control
B :  Yeah
A :  That just that is just for t. v. but it's just
A :  A really good nice one
C :  Right
A :  Which doing
C :  Yeah i would work
A :  To consider desires think they're in a mind that we got we have to have something that cheap to make
C :  Yeah that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having it at the t. v. remote can have it be
C :  Um
A :  I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff lot quicker
C :  Have it be like ergonomic so it's comparable to use uh simple to use and
A :  Yeah
C :  Looks decent hmm
A :  Maybe you know maybe even
D :  The what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though i mean if it's if it's just like
A :  Well maybe even said something that's for the disabled people also be learned
A :  Don't see very well or
A :  Big buttons for
A :  Touchy buttons uh
C :  So to find a niche for our remote the market it to a certain
A :  Yeah
C :  Kind of kind of people
B :  Yeah
C :  Certain certain demographic
A :  Or just one that looks pretty fucking cool
B :  I
D :  Mm
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah no i think you're right
B :  Could be really light or i don't know something special
C :  Yeah red rather than focus on
A :  Otherwise would be would be able to a talking about now it to a bit too this is do that means
C :  Yeah
A :  I think we should i think we should
B :  Yeah "'cause" at the end of the day if it's a it's just t. v. remote doesn't say come combination with all over
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  I really see a one where you know upset but we're all that sort of get it had some way like things to do everything in once but
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah and that's
C :  Remote spending uh from other remotes
A :  Yeah
D :  Mm
C :  Everyone lasted remotes the side
A :  Yeah that's right yeah
A :  And at that one the mixed to use well but
A :  That's not gonna
D :  I think the flip up thing "'cause" you always have this problem of like if its own that's what i did a way to get five or six remotes an alkaline on the on the cat's use common sit down and all that elephants the television set start
D :  Something so it may be something that like
D :  That's have a laid or
D :  "'cause" it's so you don't accidentally press a button or record buttons or something
A :  Okay like a lot of like a loc facts functional it like you have any telephones yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  But make it like really snazzy and cool what people want it to make it yeah
A :  Yeah it's gotta be sellable
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah that's true a user name it doesn't have to have a flip function at least have a lock functions so that it's not uh
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah
C :  Not usable when you don't want it to be usable
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  And even for kids as well it's um it's safe for them i guess like
D :  You know click on to
D :  Channels and uh that's difficult
A :  I know points out of the children
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  Oh i sort of us some ideas of it um
C :  And yes that's
A :  That's move on
C :  Good good for the
D :  Mm
A :  Oops us
A :  Okay uh okay
D :  What does i. d. a. v. i. d. and and you stand for
A :  Industrial designer
A :  Um
D :  R. i. k.
A :  Which is
D :  Have these require a specific
A :  Um
D :  I'm a marketing
B :  Mm
A :  Yeah the yeah
A :  So that's
A :  User interface designer that's
C :  That's me
A :  Yes
C :  Okay
A :  That's easy you don't you
A :  Yeah you're you're you're in we want it to look at what what buttons we need
C :  Right
A :  Um
A :  Industrial design you're the one that you know you're gonna be working out
A :  Kind of box it goes in i guess so
A :  Um
A :  We we see i
A :  Pop goes into the box
A :  Somehow
B :  Yeah how how it works so
A :  I'm marketing
D :  These are quite specific
A :  Yeah
D :  So what the user requires
A :  Yeah what
B :  Do you think a lot so you kind of overlap
D :  In a remote
A :  Oh okay yeah
B :  The kids
C :  Yeah it does seem like our our responsibilities have
D :  I guess that's what sense
A :  You too
A :  You two are gonna be just i think it is that but you know you working together
C :  Some overlap
B :  Yeah
A :  The other one is gonna go find that to the to the research
A :  See what people want in a remote
A :  What buttons to use more often and stuff like that
D :  Mm
A :  Well we've been want to finish the meeting now
A :  Okay
A :  Okay everyone well done a good meeting
C :  Alright see you in thirty minutes
A :  I
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  For
D :  Do you take it off
