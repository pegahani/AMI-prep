A :  Yeah yeah this one
A :  Well hi everyone again
C :  No
D :  And then
A :  Um
A :  Like before we uh
A :  I have to use the meetings from that then the minutes from the last meeting
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And so here we go
A :  Um
A :  Was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation
A :  From the interface are um
B :  Designer
A :  Designer i
A :  Uh that uh it
A :  Looks would be very important
A :  On this your remote
A :  And um
A :  Is to send messages of course just a t. v.
A :  It would have nine channel buttons and next but then volume but and stop type of buttons
A :  Switch to control features scholar contrast right yes etcetera
A :  Bit of a memory switch a mute but in the case the telephone rings or something
A :  Uh speech recognition is one of her very for it favourite personal uh feature she would like to see to to to to be integrated in this so um
A :  In this new remote
A :  Um
A :  Should be child friendly design
A :  Which few buttons colourful maybe v.s star shaped or other shape buttons
A :  Um
A :  She uh
A :  Presented also an oversized remote
A :  Our which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
D :  And she was challenged on that point i
A :  That's right
B :  I
A :  But the uh ray for personal favourite really she she would very much like to see a speech recogniser
A :  Integrated in this remote
A :  The industrial designer um
A :  Presented
A :  For
A :  Uh uhuh
A :  The sports on the issue
A :  She would like a special case made out of plastic side is very strong
A :  Not using any harm for materials
A :  Should be recyclable
A :  And it should be colourful
A :  It should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
A :  She would like to see a time or
A :  And or all armour facility
A :  Integrated
A :  Yeah technically this thing would also have a sister and a capacitator
A :  Diode transistor resonator
A :  And if possible a rechargeable battery
A :  Uh and of course a circuit board
A :  And how it works you press about mm the chip
A :  It's a morse morse code be data
A :  We days be uh to that channel eight
A :  To the generator
A :  Amplification
A :  And um
A :  The circuit
A :  Board is very inexpensive to build
D :  Okay
A :  And so she's things this is a great feature
A :  Alright to to to consider
A :  She would like to uh at this whole thing should be pushbuttons was a simple chip
A :  They're scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
A :  Should be battery operated
A :  And of course would have to special cases
A :  The marketing expert to our uh
A :  Who has to finally come up
A :  We just to to to market this product
A :  Has been watching the competition
A :  Last time some research on the internet
A :  And also has used for personal observations to come up
A :  With the fact that such a remote should be small
A :  Easy to use and it should be eye-catching
A :  From our point of view of course one is the most important factor is that we should get to market before our competition does
A :  To do with that
A :  Uh maybe one or two feature should be double up on which we could call on or in other words on which our campaign
A :  Could be built on
A :  Too many new features are too many points would on you can choose matter
A :  So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh
A :  Given home
A :  Oh um
A :  It should have a fruit and vegetable design
A :  And should have a soft feel she feels that's really what people want today
A :  Uh the decision that we talk last time it well us that uh
A :  These special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
A :  D. n. a. she should be battery
A :  Uh should be on a chip
A :  Should be trendy design compact and strong
A :  And should have buttons
A :  And that concludes the presentation from the last
A :  But it's for the last meeting
A :  Now um we are ready for the presentation
A :  Alt a prototype

C :  Um
C :  And also uh for the
C :  No
C :  The material is plastic and dow for the buttons that is that so uh soft rubber
C :  Oh and also
D :  Oh that's good yeah that's that's a friendly
C :  Yeah

D :  Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And then now
C :  Oh for the for the led for the light emitting diode it as a fruit was sent to you

C :  And it's out of it is up button like a lot in in introduction
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And the button buttons part um it be explain base
C :  Fine singer
B :  Okay
D :  Okay
B :  Not the uh um we decided upon including certain features um are the remote
B :  Uh these features into what's
B :  And um it's uh um signal to a meeting uh signal it's the um net or in e. d.
D :  Hmmm yellow yeah uh-huh
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I didn't read it
B :  Now that we have included the switch on and off but uh
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Now we have included other feature
B :  That is the new too but that
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And the side of the market
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Then we have included
B :  One to nine by parents
B :  For controlling the programmes the different channels
D :  Uh-huh
B :  We want to include that's two buttons for in pleasing or they could be using the board you
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And b. m. also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
B :  Not our our motto also contains uh but then we just got is the main no but that
A :  What kind of button
B :  Menu that but
A :  Menu i mean you could make it a one one
B :  That is menu
D :  Menu button line
B :  At the centre
D :  Uh-huh
B :  We have included about that
B :  But as flawless and green card and this is the menu button which will control of the colour sharpness blank yes
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Of the screen um mm
B :  Oh that's a big chair
B :  They'll all the same tool but uh but then
B :  We just got is the swapping but there
B :  No this is uh a special special feature which we have include that uh this but then
B :  It's an elongated
B :  Shaped but there and this is slightly flexible
B :  So if we can start to what's the light
B :  It would take to the previous channel if it gets down to two words that like it would be to the next round
B :  If you take the user to the previous uh the next channel so this is a
B :  Swapping back to
D :  The next channel in a numeric pad or or
B :  No stopping is if if for example you're uh you're watching the sake in china
D :  Yeah mm
B :  And then you go to the text and that and if you want to go back to the second generate a construct this or
D :  No
D :  Okay
B :  Yes
B :  And and and is it this remote as in the twice recogniser
A :  Okay
B :  Which which will recognise the uses voice
A :  Uh-huh
B :  And then you to act according to
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So this is a proposed market
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Now the marketing expert has to
C :  And yeah
B :  I think you have such a shame that it'll be celibate
D :  Is
B :  But it very cost effective or
D :  Uh okay well um
D :  Well what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one top
B :  Yes yes
D :  That you can really hold it in one that you don't need to hands and it's easily reachable
D :  Even for some of the small yeah
A :  Yes the buttons are all grey east right
D :  The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre a hand
A :  Race uh-huh
D :  You can you reach it over here
D :  So you don't have to turn it around turn it upside down
A :  Or two hands to operate it yeah
D :  Move it up up and down i really like that you really did a good job on that
D :  Well designers i i um and um i like the idea that be on off button is a really prominent place that's that's a really good good thing
A :  Yes and it sort of sticks up so at you really you don't have to first go like a we are here it on and see a uh-huh
D :  Yeah that's great
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  You know
B :  Yes yeah
D :  The colours very attractive
D :  Um be um
D :  These buttons uh around here of them you should
B :  No these are the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons
D :  These uh-huh
D :  On both sides then you say you can push either one
B :  Yes yes
B :  Yes
D :  Okay
A :  So if you're left-handed a right-handed it doesn't matter
D :  And this place the menu up on the screen
B :  And
D :  This brings the menu on on the screen and the orange ones
B :  The name yes yes
D :  Are
B :  Uh the the these these two are there will be in these are the key is the one that's
D :  Mm
D :  Oh okay
B :  And these two are two um a scroll the programme channels
D :  So okay
D :  Right right okay
B :  Scroll up a scroll on the channel
D :  That looks that looks like something i can sell
C :  I mean
D :  Yeah okay um now i'm supposed to
A :  Well i have one question
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh i will there be an easy thing we number buttons like that people know what they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
B :  Yes it could have uh these buttons we have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons would have so that's
C :  Huh
C :  Yeah definitely
A :  We'll have simple so that that
B :  Yes which can be easily recognise
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah i
A :  That they use a really know is it a one doesn't have to first lady
C :  Oh yeah
B :  Yes
D :  Good point because we need the symbols "'cause" we're going into an international market we can have anything with language dependent
B :  Yes
C :  And also
C :  Hmm
A :  Yeah
A :  But anyway what i did it it has to have some kind of all
C :  Yeah that's um
D :  Symbols on a uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Thanks
A :  Symbols text or something so that people want
B :  Yes
C :  Text that we can have on the keys it's a week that it could be printed on the keys and that's that's what it is yeah
A :  That's right
B :  Yes
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Oh okay yeah just wanna make sure that uh_huh
B :  And
B :  And manuel feature to speak we have all would have for this remote it is an artist a shape
D :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh
B :  I shall shape
D :  For the snail yeah uh-huh we have the snail shell because right back into a cell
A :  Right uh-huh
B :  Yes yes
C :  So it is uh yeah
B :  It's nice yeah
C :  Yeah sure
B :  Yes
A :  Right
D :  But you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail was not to be slow
C :  Uh-huh
D :  And we could have some sort of little
D :  Comic a factor on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would that would really work
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Here
C :  I yeah
A :  Yeah what what are our special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
D :  So
D :  I think voice recognition is our big selling point is nobody else seems to have that in in this price range
C :  Uh-huh
A :  And then and then the other thing would basically be she shape or practicality of use
C :  And then and then yeah
D :  Yeah well i i think that
D :  Everybody's gonna say the remote control is practical
D :  I think we have to we have to draw on on on appearance
A :  Colours
A :  Uh-huh
D :  You're really gonna have the best to
A :  Should just
D :  Tourists remote control on the block
D :  So i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image
D :  Um play with the visible
D :  And then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the lock
D :  And the voice recognition they're gonna be are two selling points
A :  Uh okay now uh i having said that
D :  I'm supposed to make a little presentation um mm
A :  No one and this was a revelation criteria uh which we had just have done now we're gonna
D :  Okay
A :  Talk about financing
D :  But in my instructions i think it's a response to go to the border mm to something no
A :  Well that's a production evaluation is that you
D :  Yeah that's me
A :  But that's that's that's financing
D :  Oh okay sorry so are we know that
A :  I see
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  Okay be head looks and voice recognition
A :  Okay now on the financing we bring up the um
A :  Mm yeah it is
A :  Okay
A :  Other
A :  Energy source we is say that it's
A :  Battery right
C :  Uh-huh
D :  That's right
A :  Okay now
A :  So we
A :  I guess to use one
C :  Yeah
B :  Yes
A :  Sell it right you're trying to change it for that
A :  Well that's nice
A :  Well yeah could just change it here and then it will
A :  Doesn't work
A :  Uh-huh
D :  "'kay" just fill in the yellow boxes uh
A :  Oh okay yeah okay let's see
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay one
B :  Yes
A :  Oh okay
A :  I'll go away
A :  Um the kinetic so so that's in the energy source that's all we need
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh electronic simple chip on print is that's what we using one of those
C :  Yeah
A :  Come on
A :  Okay one
A :  Uhuh
A :  Regular chip on print no
C :  No
A :  That's all we need to one
A :  Case uncurved flat it's single curved double curved
D :  Oh
C :  That's that's no
B :  Single oh no
D :  Well i guess it's double curved
A :  Double curved
A :  One of those
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Case materials supplements plastic we said right
A :  Uh wood rubber
D :  Rubber because we don't have the soft buttons
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh that but yes but
C :  I think that that that's that for for that but there is a
A :  That's just for the case material so
C :  Yeah okay it's
B :  Use this for the "'kay"
D :  Oh okay then yeah
A :  Special colour so we having that right
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And then we have to interface pushbutton it's
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Scroll-wheel no integrated scroll-wheel l. c. display
D :  No
B :  No
D :  I'm really into the clock and after all right
C :  No
A :  No
A :  Uh that button supplement special colour
B :  Spanish
B :  Yes
A :  Special form
B :  Used to be doing a special form
D :  Yes
A :  And special material rubber wood yes
A :  Oh okay
A :  Total seven point six whatever that means
C :  Uh i think that's
A :  That's the price
B :  Mm through all the
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Mm
A :  Eight eight point two
B :  Nine points
B :  Okay yes
A :  A point to right
A :  So we looks like we are
A :  Well within budget
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay
A :  Okay
A :  If if it's a it's a suppose huh
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh huh huh uh-huh
B :  That is true
A :  I just tried that
A :  My documents computer buy
C :  And uh
C :  And
A :  Uh yes yes
A :  Okay fine
A :  Five
A :  Okay good so that's the good news
A :  You gonna be popular
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  So that uh i think financing was pretty simple
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
D :  Okay i'll take my file don't see where you know
D :  "'kay" sure yeah
D :  Yeah but you just the next slide right away
A :  You want the next slide
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  Okay well obviously my method for
D :  Um as
D :  But the marketing of this thing is first as the big question will itself
D :  And i think we should so this prototype
D :  To people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning
D :  That may be little things that we haven't thought of we can accept every you suggestion of course but they we just need to get a few
C :  Yeah
D :  And show the the prototype you can see research groups we don't want somebody to suddenly come to listen tell us
D :  That this button is toxic and you know some charles well what know we were telling me
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  So we have to get input from most people
D :  And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it we think it's good
D :  We're gonna get behind it and sell it
D :  Um next slide please
D :  Okay you know the things that i was thinking and no but my wish list is really then realised in this prototype
D :  I wanted the shape to be by a more frequent in one anything with angles a little square one to be comfy and round d. so we've got that size a small the colours bright and warm which is what we wanted
D :  One of the feel to be a soft as possible we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shape you know it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that's a nice and functionality of the last i was because people i can use it but i
C :  Is it
D :  I thought paradoxically the other features in other words the lock the feel um and a shape
B :  See
D :  That's what people are gonna get in the store if they don't have a television star they can play with it
C :  Yeah
D :  Um so they'll be our main selling points
D :  So um
D :  That does it then fulfilled by your prototype
D :  Yeah and get had to the next slide please
D :  Okay so um
D :  The shape um i think
D :  Is a oh one that's really really excellent shape
D :  The size is small
D :  Um and these points are an important for the for the marketing these are
D :  In how i feel
D :  I think that it's i think the display small have to sell but i think we're sort of write the scale of one to seven and i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors
D :  At our colour i think it's great colours or bright and warming really do great job there
D :  And given that um the constraints that we had i think we got a soft as possible
D :  Yeah and then the functionality
D :  Um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could add it
D :  And the different functions for then we just or something else so i would say that we got two five out of seven on on functionality
D :  I think that there's a look at a great product and we can get off running
A :  Um
A :  I i just realise one thing in the fine and saying that was no room for our voice recogniser
D :  Yes
D :  Uh
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  And uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that
D :  Well um we had what eight euros twenty as i recall
A :  Eight a twenty yes
C :  Right
D :  And so we've got was about four euros to go to spend
C :  Yeah
C :  We'll see
A :  I mean maximum we have another four point three euros so i mean well four thirty
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Well um that's
A :  But i mean we have no way of presenting that to management
A :  And as you know as a finished
A :  As a finished product and saying okay we still waste recogniser are the costs so much
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So um we just have to
A :  You wear off that i mean and
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Know whether the four thirty would really cover that
D :  Well as we know and there's technolo technological world you can do just about anything at any price of the the the problem was quality so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
C :  Yeah
C :  Yes
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway
C :  Yeah still
A :  Yeah
D :  As we've seen the same many of these kind of i see
A :  I'm sorry to interrupt that but i just uh record uh i just remembered that there was no
A :  That that was not to um include it
C :  Mm think so yeah
A :  Uh but there was no room for any special features
C :  Mm yes
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay
A :  So to be there of that
A :  You wanna do is next slide marketing expert
D :  Uh
D :  We all i was in this my last slide it
A :  I don't know
D :  Yeah i think that was my last slide yeah
A :  Yes it is
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Um
D :  Uh-huh yeah
D :  And i'm supposed to present the scale on the white board
D :  Um and we're supposed to talk about those things that email so if you put my last slide back up there
A :  Oh
D :  I'm sorry uh um
D :  Yeah yeah
D :  Um
A :  Wow
A :  By any that out
D :  Well because i can't remember when i put on
D :  Okay yeah i'll sources see how long my we she's here
A :  I think you can make it there
D :  Okay
D :  Okay
D :  So
D :  Now we're all supposed to say what we think
D :  Um
D :  Okay so
D :  On
D :  Shape
D :  I gave it a one
D :  But what would you rather one being good and seven being the worst
B :  Was okay
D :  Um what do you think the shape it is
B :  But
D :  One okay
D :  And but that's a
A :  Yes i think a a shape this one
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay and
C :  Even like yeah she is
D :  One
D :  Okay and how about on science
D :  On size
A :  You you give it a four
D :  I'd give it a four yeah i feel it's just the average
A :  Um
A :  Oh
A :  I think that would give it at least a two
D :  Okay
B :  One
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah you mean i can get this one
D :  Okay
C :  It's quite small
D :  Okay
D :  "'kay" the designer of course you wanna give it a one i
D :  I haven't and then how about how we doing on colour
A :  Colour uh i'm
D :  Colour uh i gave it a one i really like all those nice bright one colour it's
A :  One
A :  I i liked the colours one
B :  One
D :  One
C :  Yeah one
D :  On online okay
D :  And have a a toughie all
D :  Taking and to um consideration texture
D :  And come through in here
A :  Uh at all give it a two
D :  No okay i give it a three two yeah
B :  I'll get three
D :  Three
C :  Uh maybe two
D :  True okay
C :  Yeah
D :  And the next this functionality
D :  Where i i admit i was little hard on our team here
D :  But
A :  Well it's also you can't really tried out it's uh the other things you have more it's a more tangible so
D :  Yeah are
D :  Uh-huh
A :  From that point if you but um
A :  Uh i'll give it a three
D :  Okay
D :  So okay
C :  Uh three
D :  I think
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
D :  Well um
D :  It looks like we've got we got ourselves a pretty good product
D :  Um functionalities the only place where maybe we
D :  Have to think about maybe having forbid having another me i i but
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  For uh um
D :  Otherwise i think we're ready to go to go with this product
D :  Anybody else any other comments or any anything so you feel we should evaluate
A :  Um
A :  Here is what we looking at
A :  Uh satisfaction there are um for example room for creativity
A :  Um
A :  Is there more room for creativity or are we up so we happy
C :  Maybe we can
B :  We cannot be a simple yes
C :  Yeah include some more buttons and
B :  Yes features
C :  Oh yeah features we can make the buttons few buttons more the
C :  Uh i think they're quite big
C :  So i think that i mean we we can just have small buttons and more buttons that is
C :  If we want to have
C :  More features that
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Well then again if we're gonna um
D :  To the speech recognition thing
C :  Yeah
D :  We're gonna they're gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech
C :  Yeah
B :  Yes
B :  Voice
D :  So that that's where we're gonna have to
D :  Do you maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having to mute buttons
C :  Yeah
D :  And um then
D :  Maybe we can do something with be um
D :  The volume control maybe we can put that all on one button
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Um
D :  And a couple of others maybe come to um to consolidate some of the use it so and a two week to do with that
A :  Yeah um l. all this bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't
B :  And maybe uh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Was this particular item we probably can't just uh
A :  And a whole lot of more things uh
D :  No
C :  Yeah
A :  Um we need to uh uh
A :  You know we need to leave space moneywise
D :  Uh-huh
A :  For the voice recogniser
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
C :  Oh
A :  So that the question really is how do we feel with the project process so uh
A :  Um there are we happy v.s their creativity at has
A :  Past year or we're not happy
A :  With a new product we create it well that was created
A :  Yeah i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy
D :  I'm pretty happy with that um
C :  Yeah i'm happy
A :  Um
A :  And
