A :  Um
A :  Hmmm project plan
A :  So does anyone have any uh thoughts
A :  Has to the tool training that to uh is required
C :  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training
A :  Mm yeah my or something
A :  Oh i see so we should really be
A :  Oh right okay so
A :  So we have the project in which is to um
A :  Basically to come up with a new remote control device
A :  Uh
A :  We have uh starting this was the original
A :  Which is been in existence number four
A :  Period of time
A :  And uh
A :  Or idea is to uh uh
A :  To make a new remote control device so uh more user friendly than the previous one
A :  And to
A :  To be trendy are to be with it and effort to uh
A :  To get a better market share their audience
A :  So um
A :  The method of doing this is uh split up
A :  As you can see into uh
A :  The functional design
A :  You conceptional design and detailed design
A :  So um
A :  In each of these uh feasible the
A :  You should be handing over to your cells the design is of those uh
A :  This device
A :  And they're having a meetings
A :  So that we can uh during the course of today
A :  Yeah and come up with uh huh
A :  Better better and some implement we had before um therefore um of a successful or conclusion
A :  "'cause" it a
A :  Um
A :  And you
A :  You'll be doing uh this designs
A :  Uh so today
A :  To make this thing
A :  So we got to say
A :  Try it white board
A :  Uh
A :  I
C :  Uh huh
A :  So or or uh
A :  Right so basically everyone's to uh supposedly until the favourite animal
A :  Over on the whiteboard over there i guess this is the
A :  They show the white board works
A :  So where
A :  I don't know which is to go first
A :  Do we still have a forced by sure that whatever
D :  Okay
C :  Um
A :  Ah
A :  Uh
C :  Could have a pop-up it's today
D :  Like for instance
A :  No no you're you're you're you know move out from the microphone
A :  And the camera
A :  I think yeah that
C :  Oh supposed to do this right now do you think all
A :  I would mm i would guess so a board room
B :  You've lost uh you might and
D :  I don't know
A :  Yeah
A :  Technical problems i mean you designers america but what i would i i uh-huh
C :  He'll go
C :  All t.
C :  I think that i would have to see
C :  Uh my favourite animal
C :  Is
C :  But i
A :  Mm
C :  A square look at it
C :  Um and this would be
C :  Because the very independent
C :  Uh at the very intelligent
C :  Compared to dogs maybe
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  And it can be very very affectionate some people don't think so
C :  But i know very affectionate packets um
C :  Um and then after themselves
A :  I reckon mm next
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Shot of our actually
A :  I don't see is is any need to there's plenty of space i mean uh
A :  Whatever
D :  A whole menagerie
A :  Exactly
B :  Sure so i'm gonna cost so it's kinda we have it
A :  We've got more time to prepare over the sides of all stuck or bits and pieces that but it's i
B :  I didn't think of that
B :  Okay um
A :  The three bands or how many
B :  Hands are here i'll try the right okay
B :  Okay um
B :  Um can make a roof oh uh
B :  But that was similar to draw a very well
A :  Hmm
B :  I have a bunch of it
A :  Yeah march or just a compression
B :  I
B :  Who who are lost uh
B :  I can think of
D :  Yeah
B :  Um
A :  So you just interface i
B :  Okay uh we go for uh
A :  I
B :  But it's a small small that but
B :  Mm
B :  Um
B :  The lime and well that's nothing like that because uh and
B :  As a maybe "'cause" the same any cartoon characters may the past but uh
B :  Like jungle put it this stuff
D :  Right
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Well um i'm gonna go for the dog
D :  I'm gonna draw one partly as well
D :  Um
D :  It seems like it's going to fit that "'cause" and uh something
C :  That's quite right
D :  Right so that's my part um
D :  I like dogs because the very little
D :  And they're always happy so whenever one of your feelings it a bit
D :  It down or tie it to know is coming up and there was a quite excited
D :  So um you go with a lot of fun with that dog
D :  And there are so good for exercise findings we can now and i was it never get tie it in
D :  When a tactical kids well so
A :  Hmm
D :  Okay that's why i like dogs
A :  Mm
A :  Right um
A :  Yeah
A :  Well i'm not actually had too many pets a problem i had time "'cause"
A :  To be honest with you where
A :  Oh right um i'm not too keen on them anyway not to worry so what my boss is a got a moment is they've got to a few fish and so hopefully um one group too difficult at all
A :  And i think
A :  If
A :  As you can see that my are just have to stick work as useless as well
A :  Yeah we um
A :  And uh
A :  One of the best uh things about fish is that we don't really take yeah
A :  Too much looking after
A :  Because uh with most of the animals if you're gonna win holiday or whatever
A :  You later
A :  Spend money or get a friend or whatever to look at software whereas if you a fish
A :  You just gonna put the food and uh a a doctor feed which feeds "'em" over the yeah a couple weeks your way and uh
A :  Change was every couple months and
A :  Line a few plants so
A :  Other than that to keep dying an official right i bet that are not the r. r. result panes in that they're they're low maintenance i would yeah
A :  Right
A :  Okay
A :  Oh okay yeah uh first of all with us
A :  Right okay yeah so
A :  Or "'cause" been on on uh
A :  This uh project for by the um
A :  Twenty five euros is the the uh expected to
A :  Some place
A :  Uh affirmation has come from a marketing manager here
A :  So we're looking to sell internationally not just in europe or looking at um
A :  Having a production costs limited to uh at twelve
A :  And a half euro per unit
A :  And therefore making uh
A :  Profit margin
A :  Of uh well nice yep profit margin it's uh
A :  Because of this even know what it's an this other calls to a take
A :  Uh from uh
A :  From that to give your profit margin per unit
A :  And so the penny what the uh the overhead uh costs are
A :  All the time and um
A :  How many units we're uh okay to sell or
A :  Projecting to sell this point time
A :  So um
A :  Experience with remote control first ideas
A :  Your remote so
A :  I guess or
A :  Looking at um
A :  What is special this point trying to help
A :  Ja you um
A :  Folks designing our our new model as it were so uh
A :  Any any thoughts um
B :  Um
B :  Uh maybe far as a remote controls buttons a little small like we have to press
B :  So we can make something we have uh
B :  Easy to press that
B :  As as the main function
A :  O. k. so
A :  So basically we're looking for some um one of the device
A :  Yeah it is
A :  Um
A :  Robust
A :  Um
A :  Um therefore uh
A :  We'll get done this too easily
A :  Um mm looking for
A :  Device
A :  That is uh was are the things you said there
B :  And so if easy to use the buttons uh access for
A :  Easy to use
A :  You use
B :  Aziz use and see
A :  And see
A :  Okay
A :  Yeah
C :  Just check
C :  It's it's just a television remote
C :  Because a lot of um
C :  Systems okay the t. v. video combine know a t. v. d. v. d. combined
A :  Uh-huh
C :  One the most annoying things as having like five year olds in the house
C :  So if you got combine system
C :  It could be a combine true
C :  Always adjust the television not supposed to do
A :  Well um we sell get back on that but it seems to me sensible as a as you already said
A :  Another more annoying than having three or four devices list of of the uh by the time and uh
A :  So uh device for
A :  For all remote
B :  So so so you can
D :  Okay yeah um well things um we found in the market research is that
D :  It off to get confused by the number of buttons on them as well this is quite often lots lots
D :  And um
D :  Sometimes
D :  The weights of remote controls to feed them but this because
D :  Yes i think that yeah and the remote is somewhere else in the room
D :  So
D :  Where's in the past you'd have to go to change the channel
D :  No you have to get a sense to pick up the remote so
D :  So i do we need to maybe think about how
D :  Um
D :  We could maybe uh
D :  Developer of the control which restaurant i think
D :  I don't know
A :  No no i think
C :  As to whistle
D :  That's that's maybe something for the future in in talk to television but
A :  But is it in a sense is to to um mutually exclusive you can't have bought the
A :  The one device and then have few
A :  Buttons on it
A :  Two "'cause" you want you want simplicity as well you want
A :  In e. d. it to be able to use it
D :  Yeah
A :  Well so at the same time you want
A :  As you rightly say one remote for all
A :  And so these are
A :  Probably mutually exclusive options
A :  That to
A :  Uh-huh you could argue that experience
A :  Of using devices and similar devices as people get more more used to using remotes there for the more of a with and then um therefore you can make the more complicated as time goes on
B :  They week and then have that instructions with the remote so we just in the design a remote control itself or so to use so she's that would come with that
A :  No
A :  That's your instructions
D :  Yeah
D :  I mean
D :  Please
D :  Done some research uh um
D :  About sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices all
D :  And a lot of them sort of use you know that like the light maybe laptops
D :  It is possible that we could devise a system where
D :  Where you're you're basically sort of holding a major computer which is controlling only oh
D :  You also the u. or television in your stereo
D :  And where you know if you buy a new thing then it's sort of
D :  You could link it to that as well
D :  Maybe
A :  Oh okay
A :  Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting so
A :  Uh we have to uh uh start winding up
A :  Um
A :  Is there
A :  Next meeting in thirty minutes
D :  Okay
A :  So um
A :  Right so we've got i. d. d.
A :  Come on mine
D :  You just click return it should be okay
D :  Get rid of a message
B :  That was not
A :  Hmm well uh
D :  If you hit it is it return it should get rid of a message
A :  Yeah
A :  Oh there we go i i thought was looking for work right so
D :  Right "'cause" no
A :  We've got functional
A :  Or or or harm to the
C :  And that might want to start
D :  Yeah
C :  If you grab the kind of yeah
B :  Oh this is this like phone thing
C :  Like to the left to pull it out
D :  Yeah
A :  Right
A :  Right
A :  Sorry about that okay it's still we've got um the working design
A :  For i. d. e. d. u. i. d. the technical functions design
A :  Marketing a user requirement specification
A :  Specific instructions sent to you by your personal and by your personal coach
A :  So
A :  We all clear what
A :  Okay "'cause" we're going to me to the next thirty minutes
A :  And i guess i'll try and write up some minutes of the this meeting
A :  To uh
A :  To get you for
A :  So next meeting
C :  I'm not it's not clear on what we design a new remote cool is if someone multifunctional
C :  Or two of
C :  Set ourselves up or we work on that
B :  I think is the the stars television remote
A :  A television remote control
B :  Just stick to that and as we get told otherwise
A :  That's true "'cause" it during during the course of or do we might make decisions based on information on meetings that would change
A :  Where we're going but at this point and i think you're right that uh
A :  So i make a just a t. v.
A :  Oh okay
A :  So
A :  No the part
A :  I will stay here and um break off
A :  I'm not the minutes and um we'll see you in half an hour
B :  "'kay" it's great
D :  Okay
A :  Oh okay yeah
A :  Right it's
