D :  Mm
A :  Mm
D :  So
D :  Yes
B :  It's
D :  It's
D :  Uh
B :  Mm
A :  Okay uh
A :  And as you can have it for the slide many okay
C :  Sure
A :  Okay welcome back
A :  I hope for you have uh fresh eight in the first time
A :  How is not the um making actually we
A :  Getting here
A :  To discuss the board uh functional design
A :  Meeting
A :  Okay and uh really see some information from uh on all feel and it's and uh i think uh
A :  And the shooting for that and uh i will invite the the christian and eighty eight and uh agnes to discuss the board on the various subjects
A :  So can you go to the next slide
A :  Yeah uh that region of the meeting is the opening
A :  Then uh
A :  I'm going to talk about the the project management board i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing the project management then sector could both
A :  But it would take the minutes of the meeting
A :  And there are three presentations one is the new project requirements
A :  And the second one know what to a decision on remote control functions
A :  And uh uh finally be a closing oh oh and the meeting time will be our forty minutes
A :  So you know to be very quick
A :  And i'll come up with the management come with the new proposal okay and uh our to discuss a few points on this
A :  Oh boards this
A :  New insights in that came off your project
A :  But the one is uh the teletext becomes a alt more that
A :  Okay because of uh because of the computer systems and uh at new technology
A :  So we don't need to constrain really aboard the teletext and all in all the new project design
A :  The second one is about uh
A :  The remote control
A :  Should be used only for the t. v.
A :  That's what are the management say yes
A :  And the powerpoint it's a very very important
A :  To establish all are uh marketing or or a car break image
A :  Okay with this new project or new product
A :  Okay
A :  So i will enlight uh
A :  Agnes can you go to the court slide
C :  No this is the third side
A :  Okay this
A :  So
A :  I'll invite uh christine to discuss about uh the functional design
B :  Okay i don't know
B :  Open the
C :  Ah
C :  You
C :  Just mm
B :  And number two
B :  That's it
C :  John master shot needed
B :  I'll do that so thanks
B :  So well um
B :  Well i i figured to uh
B :  We should
B :  Um identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh and from
B :  Research i did
B :  Uh the
B :  The device as trend television on and off the first time you press on the big button he can't uh
B :  Can have like a waffling on this point two only had a nice to be able you have to be able to find it
B :  "'cause" one because problems with
B :  Remote controls as
B :  Finding them
B :  So uh i also since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product
B :  No they're look at things that are are popular and um text go beyond or some is a certain first meeting
B :  Um and then uh we might wanna talk about actually about the materials that appropriate to use and uh and the construction especially the uh the outside of uh
B :  Product so that it gives the appearance and it's reliable and so forth
B :  I did a little history on than that the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth so
B :  I guess the sky it's mean if uh create the flash manic
B :  Check i like the idea "'cause" it made me think of fun
B :  Um maybe the remote control made a big flash when you uh you turn the t. v. i don't know that might be interesting
B :  And um mm i so it was highly directional flashlight
B :  That uh you could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels so i think um those are still requirements we have today uh
B :  Fifty years later
B :  And uh what was really a pioneering innovation but it was uh a sense if the sign so that they would get
B :  Would start off by the
B :  You get it would
B :  Easily "'cause" um problems
B :  So well uh
B :  I in addition to uh we looking at the um uh the functional price all these devices are examples of where uh them they represent
B :  Examples that are available today
B :  One in the middle
B :  Is it um they really are
D :  Fantastic
B :  Something to keep in mind be easy to find
B :  And um
B :  It would uh you you could well it things if the t. v. didn't turn out a few good
B :  Use it for something else
B :  And since i'm not really um
B :  Industrial designer i didn't i know what to do with the slide
B :  But um
B :  I it just talk some different
B :  Uh schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is for the slide might look like if you were going a circuit board that but i don't know why um
B :  Rasta this
B :  So
B :  Oh i
B :  Personal preferences
B :  Um
B :  I think we could uh a hole in thinking outside the box here i think that we should consider perhaps having an l. and uh uh size uh a remote control it changes in size depending on the user preference so something is very very flexible an inflatable man you could shrink it
B :  Um that you can either be you can go either one extreme be very colourful or you could make it
B :  Clear and um kind of
B :  Blend in with things are you do have to um uh it have a problem with that the declaration of the of the users home
B :  Um i think uh it it needs to be waterproof because uh
B :  Sometimes they fall into a cup send you know might be uh by the swimming pool or something like that
B :  Um if you right now what what what am i requirements was about it needs to to tell you when it's done its job or not because at the time i keep pushing on the remote control on it
B :  Don't know if it's actually
B :  Understood my message so i think it should give you some sort of an oral q.
B :  And now course i never wanna replace the battery
B :  So that's those are my preferences and that's my presentation
A :  Yeah let me uh interrupt your uh if you can add other facility are the future like uh unbreakable
B :  Yes
A :  Okay because uh
A :  Especially true they you know you have the family and okay it's okay and the kids the board and the the play with the remote site and in your c. s. okay so if you can add the future okay for you or of fabric whatever you are or train design okay with unbreakable locating but we do
B :  One over with the car
A :  A lot of advantage
A :  For our product
B :  Good idea
A :  I'm not sure
B :  Good idea a lot on
A :  Maybe you can uh add it in that
B :  Yes okay
A :  Okay how i think it is jane and uh uh any questions or or uh classification source
A :  Any discussion on the functional design
C :  Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials
C :  As for example in the unbreakable think doing something plastic would be harder works
C :  Having something like
C :  And and steal or titanium isn't really eat economically i have all all of
B :  Titanium
B :  Titanium v.
B :  Be handy to wouldn't it
C :  Yeah
B :  No i haven't really uh um i went feedback i think we need a break trying to use that we'll see what you're uh personal preferences are a new parts
C :  Yeah
C :  Sure yeah
C :  No i'm just wondering whether the you had any
B :  I like titanium it's a light
C :  Yeah
B :  Uh
D :  Expensive
B :  Yeah but the whole as i said we were uh you know nobody tell me how much what our financial objective is so on
C :  The marketing i
A :  Yes
A :  Yeah
B :  It be hard inflate something i made a titanium no
A :  Yeah that the uh until it because the the last meeting we supposed this "'cause" the board the financial thing
A :  Uh let me go quickly maybe if we can go back
A :  And the larger project plan and the budget
A :  So we can close this sure
A :  So mm
A :  So that you see it's it's uh
C :  That's cursed mm
A :  This is just hmm
C :  That's mine
A :  It's it's okay
A :  "'s"
C :  Mm
D :  I know i think verbal that we can i can pretty much uh
A :  Okay uh either i was an email okay you know project maybe the the project a okay
A :  Oh the end of the day the company of of wants to make at least uh the fifty million euro okay
A :  And uh of court the price will be the t. v.s in both on the the sale side okay that to maybe you didn't talk to your work though how much of the price and the words uh
A :  How much it's cost for them and fighting and how much it's going to be we said in the market
A :  Okay then uh you can come back with your feedback and uh i have one maybe the us additional being in this remote control okay
A :  It can be for like to you know or should be used for any t. v.
A :  Okay
A :  And it would be select okay and the
B :  That fact
A :  Not fact
B :  Yeah yeah
B :  I'd be hard to find know
A :  But let's try it okay with the different uh the designs okay the functional designs
B :  Oh okay
A :  So any other questions
D :  Oh a former side i don't think uh
D :  It's too many more questions
A :  Okay
D :  You can come to do
A :  Thank you tested for uh a time being so then uh
A :  Yeah it's so can you tell a board
D :  Okay from the marketing uh for the marketing side just to to give an idea with the managers looking for
D :  Looking for a remote control to that was
C :  It's
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Oh
D :  I have a sales price of twenty five euro
D :  With the production price or for half a euro
D :  For what so i think for what we're trying to find which we were looking for i don't think that price is exactly
D :  In the market
D :  Okay i'll explain myself in our in the sense that uh
D :  In a in a recent survey is
D :  Of from the age is for for fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy
D :  Twenty five euros so that's that's a pretty reasonable price that the market price right now
D :  Yeah for gonna take away ask
D :  And push this top of that
D :  Make it more expensive but there's an added things that they don't have now
D :  The middle you could possibly sell a piece of address "'cause" they're too expensive than a comeback
D :  But
D :  I think uh there's one other thing interesting to things that are interesting uh uh is that uh from the fifteen to thirty five year old group
D :  Which uh we spend more money on trendy new things
D :  Speech recognition is request
D :  Can we talk between
B :  It's a picture
D :  Seventy five to ninety percent
D :  Of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on remote
D :  Obvious we can make a remote into a computer but maybe simple comments
D :  Uh the lower
D :  So after
D :  On off
D :  That might be a possibility even know what costs more
D :  Be the first on the market produce that's
D :  Thirty five percent said it too difficult to you
D :  So we had gone away make it in more user-friendly
D :  Of thirty percent said we can find the remote half the time
D :  So maybe one word speech recognition commands a remote and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it to do it in terms of newspapers magazines whatever you have a whole
D :  But
D :  And the cost that the the management of looking for us not gonna be possible
D :  But it's a strange if it's fancy stats and colour to
D :  Is very easy easy to use it as get simple remote
D :  Speech from all thumb control like a certain hour or so after change channel
D :  On off
D :  Remote because be beep i can find them my role without any half a day looking for getting all of sector they can turn the t. v. yeah
D :  So we have a look at it in this global idea with the ideas
D :  The initial design
D :  Price obviously we have to talk about
A :  So what they think about uh
A :  The design so it just a bit think you can make it or or
B :  Uh i'm sorry
A :  Would you think about the the design of what was talking about
D :  Speech recognition
A :  With the speech recognition
B :  Well um training there's always an issue with the
B :  Commands
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So um mike to uh
B :  We can perhaps uh um
B :  Do it if they use trust willing to
B :  Spend some time in the training process they could reduce that
B :  But uh
B :  The overall um
B :  Cost
B :  Not sure how
B :  But um in in mind um
B :  I i think ah so that that this might
B :  Impact the battery life
B :  And them so maybe what we'll have to do is
B :  Um and something where you can
B :  Uh mm
B :  Recharge it
B :  Wireless link
B :  So that uh you hear a cents an hour to it
B :  So or maybe et cetera um assign it to uh you know it's uh from the light
B :  Um as a solar cell inside there so that uh
B :  You have enough
B :  It used to do all these fancy things
C :  It seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t. v. there's a lot of and the and sound and it's more it's it's not just in the noises like something heading
C :  It's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recogniser is good enough
C :  The filter out the t. v. speech
C :  And the the user speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying the think tank
B :  Off
C :  All the side you have someone in the movie saying off in your screen nice
C :  Because the trigger the remote control and it's turn off your t. v.
C :  So
C :  I think if we can find a speech recogniser they can handle those types of problems
C :  Then you have you really good marketing gimmick but
C :  I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact
C :  The situation
B :  Very good point
D :  Because uh well with speech recognition um mm that
D :  Uh-huh that
D :  Mm good at that idea but uh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  It's it's a one word
D :  Recognition "'cause" i know with telephones in cars and things i've seen in this they say uh minimises com all the calls up model
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay the radio can be on any everything
D :  Because i think's with speech recognition or for the the the remote for like telephone
D :  It has it
D :  Exactly word that has to here
D :  I don't think it would come through the sentence the television some is speaking on the senate television and stop us a remote
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
D :  So i think that uh uh something could be designed to recognise single word
C :  Oh yeah yeah
D :  Like that like the telephone
C :  It's a great idea if we can design it's it isn't to see those are
D :  No because i really this is this is years ago in united states we were planning on his call on the telephone call immediately
C :  Yeah
D :  So i was kinda cute
A :  What what i can uh uh so just to a christian okay uh if you need some oh oh
A :  The technical feedback on some findings
A :  Okay
A :  About the this facility especially for the speech recognition
A :  I can take them and you some companies like a in a chair or i. b. m. okay because they're already in this uh speech recognition or okay
A :  And uh you can maybe have some uh technical back go from them some kind of for technical by yep
A :  Okay and uh if you want i can coordinate okay to get some information
A :  Again do you can uh let me know okay so what kind of uh
A :  The detailed see the quite
A :  Okay to add this future
A :  And this project
A :  I don't think it's the the difficult
A :  And uh we need to know how much is the time frame you need to do
A :  Report from or what have to agree
B :  Okay we'll find that out
D :  From from your side the uh you have to go back to management is
A :  Yes
D :  Hmmm be morse precise what do they want to uh risk take a risk on the market something is gonna cost more but it could very easily
A :  Yes
D :  Make a bomb in the market
D :  Because it has to be something totally different hasn't it was totally new something that nobody has right
A :  Yeah but
D :  It's gonna cost
A :  But end of the day you all those sales guys so i will come i can sit on your hard because uh you're going to do your cells projection okay
A :  It's uh of course it's a good job but uh the management how much it's cost us and how much are going to benefit okay
D :  Hmm
D :  Sure sure
A :  And uh uh so i don't mind to can veins okay the management to spend uh some more money on the project okay if you can make all of
D :  Sorry sorry
A :  The money from this one
D :  If the bottom line is positive
A :  Okay i don't mind the cameras though are the management okay the management say is oh okay so they they don't want certain facilities which it's already war okay they want something very new locate i think a a like a speech recognition definitely there are like they i don't think the signal for that okay and uh i hope like and uh convinced the management on that
A :  So if you have any a new i. d. also care for uh you you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any
A :  Oh it's special okay accord nation okay between a near technical company that you can uh
A :  Hide the technology backup
A :  Okay
A :  But you're the functional design or technical design okay then i'm ready to do that
A :  And the what's your comments about uh
C :  Um
C :  Well i mean maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective it is and how it ties into the other two comments
A :  Yeah so you're finished eighth have so i can uh
D :  Yes
A :  Okay right yeah and that's uh i mean
A :  It's a are those
A :  Are you yeah
C :  Mm because
A :  Spends three
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay so
C :  Yes
A :  Is it okay
C :  Yeah that's fine
C :  Okay so
C :  Basically it
C :  The master that we usually use it in the user interface design is that we need to look what people like a want people don't like about existing products in our case existing remote controls
C :  And then what the good ideas are not that bad idea is r. n. y. they're bad and that which isn't always is obviously seem to have intuitions about why
C :  Things are good things are bad but when you look
C :  Technically how it works
C :  Sometimes that's not the case
C :  There we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep is that all feed into those
C :  Ads work and christians work
C :  Um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
C :  So in terms of the functionalities that we need obviously need to be able to turn the t. v. on and off you need to change channels
C :  But by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing
C :  You need to build to control the volume and then control any menus on the t. v.
C :  It's a regular a contrast or whatever
C :  So the problem is that people of expenses that is too many buttons on remote controls in general
C :  The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do
C :  Um off and let you need to know specific button sequences
C :  To get certain functionalities time um which you don't necessarily always remember special effects of functionality but you don't use very often
C :  And that the buttons are too small
C :  So here we've got two examples where
C :  Here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots lots of buttons the buttons and a lot of cases i find me
C :  Um the hard to see and okay there label but it's
C :  The labels don't necessarily tell you to match was on the other side you have a much simpler remote control
C :  That i think basically has a minimum functionalities
C :  That i need it and
C :  It sort of look simple uh and just
C :  Well supposing when you first look at it so i would be inclined to go certain words this
C :  In terms of designer rather than theirs
C :  And at a specific functionalities or require more buttons or we can figure how to do with existing
C :  Um buttons
C :  So my personal preferences are to keep the number buttons to limit or to a minimum sorry
C :  Make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed so like the on button being really obvious one
C :  The channel changing and the volume
C :  And to keep the design basically sleek and sample
C :  Which i think ties into what christine and add of both sides
C :  Fairly reasonably
C :  Um so that's pretty much in it and
C :  I dunno if you guys have any
C :  Questions or
B :  Oh i was so um seems
B :  Very understandable clearly your research and uh
B :  An hour's uh having in the same direction and
B :  And so um
B :  Uh
B :  The only thing that i was so are missing from uh your your research that we found
B :  Where's the said ability to find
B :  The doubt and then when you need it
C :  Yes that's true
B :  So uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all your table so that if we think are there in our research indicates certain things and
B :  Um
B :  Uh well as complementary
B :  I also think that um
B :  Uh
B :  That's the the feel of it is uh
B :  When you hold it
B :  Is something that um
B :  Uh was expressed more and in in in my uh
B :  Design
C :  Mm uh-huh
B :  And that's logical and normal "'cause" those are the pro parameters the industrial designers more thinking about all the look and feel
B :  And um your
C :  Well it's actually very important factor especially to users who are gonna be mind thing and i'm using it almost on and
B :  For yeah
C :  Daily basis um a lot of cases i think
B :  Mm
B :  Okay so i don't have any questions sounds good
A :  So
A :  For anybody need uh any help from full time being
A :  On this uh subjects okay so
C :  Well
A :  Let's come back to me and the question maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical
A :  Uh the company's to help you for to make a design uh slim
A :  Okay and to add some features like what that what were the speech recognition or not
C :  Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include "'cause" we've thrown a lot of features on to the table but
C :  Do we actually want to incorporate all of them or
C :  And we missed anything
D :  Hmm
B :  Don't go back and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
B :  That's alright sounds
A :  "'s" oh not really this one we at all
D :  The reactions
B :  Well it says individual actions
B :  It's it's a user so i supposed to do the components concept
B :  Supposed to work on the user interface concept we are supposed to keep watching the trends
B :  Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach
B :  I think we should do is in many features as uh start with all of them right now on eliminate them later in the process is my suggestion
A :  Okay that would be great
A :  Mm
A :  And uh i'll send you the the minutes of mate
B :  You could object if you want to it
C :  No i'm just thinking in terms of time like if
D :  She rejected i
C :  Yes nine adapting know i mean i was thinking is it really practical to start designing something the features that we just gonna and not throwing away i mean it takes a lot of
C :  Time and a half or
C :  For everyone to
C :  Consider different features
C :  Um
C :  And see if we spend the time and effort on features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend that
C :  On this thinking more about features that we actually do want that
D :  Although we used to we still have
B :  I think should take that as an action item for after the meeting "'cause" we are meeting time is right now somebody else's got it uses round and you know we can hang out here and talk about this so
C :  I guess
D :  Yeah
C :  Share
C :  Yeah sure
A :  Okay what do this know what would take for lunch break okay then uh we can discuss for the more
A :  Okay with our ideas and uh then we will come back again and uh the next week
A :  So thanks for coming and uh i was in the midst of making and the please which are all information in the shelling for that so everybody can share the information
A :  Okay
A :  So let's go for less time
B :  Thank you very much
D :  I agree
A :  Mm
