A :  Last meeting we uh discuss it be conceptual design and you
A :  I ask you to put it uh
A :  That one
A :  What a remote control
B :  I
A :  I'd be eating
B :  I
B :  Okay
A :  So let's see
B :  Yeah so
A :  Did you do that
B :  Can you go on to the shared folder
B :  Mm the shared folder uh
A :  Shape for the for the your presentation
B :  We have a presentation
A :  Because i have to
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh
B :  Oh
B :  So i go there but this than uh
B :  Three
B :  Three
B :  It's a final design
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay
A :  That's true
C :  But it's
B :  So so discuss you you you
B :  Yeah
B :  And uh
B :  And so
B :  And we we are both agree on some of
B :  Two versions of the prototypes
B :  Because we were no no they said that with the one that they have an l. c. d. on on because is too expensive
B :  So we come up with two versions
B :  One beep and one without l. c. d. "'s"
B :  Um but but come see if a charger
B :  And then detachable
B :  Ed or or it on parental control more do
B :  And detective the big buttons for people
B :  Um
B :  So
C :  Okay so i can show you the two prototypes
C :  You uh the first one
C :  It the beauty for the uh l. c. d. display and it's
C :  Yeah
C :  And the you can uh and just um goes into the um the navigation menu by uh text the joystick like yeah button
C :  You can uh to direction and and
C :  If you just push on it it's consider like a rat enter function
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Do we have on the on the side here
C :  The microphone for the
C :  For the speech recognition system here
C :  And he and uh the switch that control if you want
A :  Well you well you you
A :  For t. v.
A :  That's right
C :  Well i i i think uh
C :  It's there
A :  It's not a good
A :  Yes we do about that
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah it's the all our um camera uh microphones and
C :  That's
B :  The the microphone picks up
C :  Yeah
B :  The speeches from any
D :  Is it and only a single mike or microphone uh
C :  One or so it's a microphone array
B :  I
A :  Oh it's a costly
C :  And you know
A :  Microphone okay
C :  It's just a single microphone and
C :  In i i think yeah oh we we put it here because
C :  I think when you when you are browsing your l. c. d.
D :  Yeah
C :  You will be close to where it's better to to to christian down here
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  For instance
B :  Yeah
C :  And here is a little switch that control if you want to the speaker or recognition system
C :  To uh to be uh not off
C :  And that
C :  Uh huh so this is my remote control comes up read its charger
A :  How much so it's it's close this one
C :  Well this this prototype p. z. made for about uh whether five fifteen the fifteen dollars
B :  Forty
B :  Yeah oh
A :  Fifteen dollars
C :  Fifteen to us but uh what
A :  It's in for example the beach yes
C :  It's not it's not uh
C :  Yeah but it's just a prototype and if we uh
C :  If we optimise is there um then uh
D :  The course of a reduced
C :  Yeah the to the can and the the production costs
C :  We we can achieve um about to ten dollars
A :  A menu
A :  Battery
A :  Yeah
C :  On an excuse me
A :  Okay
C :  Well uh of the tree
C :  We use uh about uh
B :  Is that mm
B :  The two eighties great reason
C :  Yep
B :  A a rechargeable batteries
C :  We talked about of course because we have to talk about
B :  Yeah but we we had a charger so it's no problem
C :  And you just
A :  So one one battery
C :  What oh uh yeah one battery
D :  It's a two or one
B :  Uh-huh
A :  It's kitty take
A :  Is there
B :  Actually they are
B :  It's a flexible thing you just an uh
D :  No was or the rating for that
C :  There
D :  What is reading
D :  What type of battery
C :  Oh yeah is just the rose simple battery or a change of uh uh
B :  Yeah
C :  If you like it exist
B :  Yeah
D :  Something like that to a a preset is that yes
C :  Yeah
D :  Hmm hmm
C :  So and if you want to charge a battery you just
C :  Put the remote control like that
B :  Yeah
C :  Peggy and uh
B :  Yeah
C :  Charger r. and d. v. to i don't
C :  Meets all right then the next time you pick it
C :  Well
B :  At that
C :  It works
B :  Yeah i thought that area there is on the uh think about them there
C :  Yeah just explain the button uh huh
B :  It is but
B :  Yeah alright
B :  This button is like the malls it's like a joystick
B :  You can move in train a sixty degrees of direction so we can make it from
B :  And it
B :  The additional functions associate that or the actions and then you have a big you know doubleclick
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Or in a single button
B :  Can move up down left right
B :  Like endorsing
B :  So i'll sing to the led else in the right
B :  He finds other functions
B :  So
B :  You would do is a single button but it is pretty as flexible because of the trend and sixty degree more buttons
D :  And the l. c. d. is this one on the remote
B :  This is the version it becomes a l. c. d.
D :  Yeah
B :  You present another version you've got the l. c. d.
A :  I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
A :  Well function
A :  It's bad thing
A :  Getting the story
B :  Ah
A :  You do
B :  Okay
C :  Yeah that's
B :  This new prototype uh
C :  Yeah so we have the the second dash and also with the different uh a button configuration
C :  The so the notion is it's a simpler we uh we uh just uh to put the microphone so
B :  I
C :  So basically it's the same that's
D :  And also the seats
C :  Yeah i basically it's the same uh things that that has uh i presented before
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  If you we have uh we have a four buttons for navigation press one button uh acting as a enter button
C :  So uh according to what you said it's more robust to the user
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And there it's also cheaper to produce can produce a set remote control for about uh for that out
B :  I
A :  I don't know this
A :  Basic
A :  Good
D :  And i think the for the points here to have an button to find the charger
B :  Oh i'm not that was that actually
D :  Because as a major does that
C :  Yeah it's it's uh
B :  Look um the deadline at north
C :  It's embedded in the
B :  Yeah
C :  Speech recognition system
D :  Okay
D :  And if you'd disable speech recognition system then
B :  What what oh i'll come to that when it down
D :  Mm hmm hmm
C :  So now mine will explain to you
A :  And maybe maybe said they
D :  Okay
A :  Chances with this
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  They they
A :  We can was want to
C :  Of course you
B :  I did this in the in the the charger in a in idea that abortions he did they he they use the same charger
A :  So the price of the charger include that in be
B :  Uh it's a standard more do you want so you should get for each price
C :  Thank you
A :  Uh-huh
B :  I
C :  So
B :  It's the same charger they can use for the hand phone but
B :  Uh again there's one
B :  The types
B :  I think we have the investigate more on that but
A :  The price should be be you know
A :  Twelve and half euro
A :  That's
B :  But as the marketing manager say is people use women two people are willing to pay more
B :  For good design
D :  Yeah people are willing to pay more but they combine is not willing to invest more
A :  We have we have to
C :  I
B :  Yeah
A :  The price of selling the is twenty five euros
D :  At the moment
B :  Yeah
B :  Hmm
A :  And the price of
C :  Alright these are the one on line with the special features
A :  Production
D :  Oh uh
B :  Yeah well uh come out that they the the the thing that make this the controller chip is that
B :  It is more do the
B :  So you one more function you pay more
B :  Even less function
B :  He's the one i reasonable price you pay for the functions that you get
B :  On to the system
B :  So you so uh what will uh
A :  Uh so there is bases function and if you want more if you take a
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  Something uh customised yeah
B :  Press on the l. c. d. v. d. you can put it back in or you can use you know um
A :  Yeah
B :  Or i
B :  The speech recogniser is a microphone yeah yeah
B :  Than a microphone clean
B :  Then i
B :  Should i
B :  Yeah pay less for the system is it
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
B :  So oh
D :  Mm okay
B :  It's pretty flexible in the
C :  You also have the
C :  The the two other might use for the prototype control
B :  Yeah yeah it's represented
C :  Isn't that that you can
D :  Um this is other one
C :  You can have that
C :  True
B :  I
C :  To your remote control you you if you uh if you want to to what mark
C :  More power on what you do
B :  Yeah
C :  And uh we channel you want to choose uh and so on
C :  A year is just the the the major or for the kids
C :  And
C :  The if the parents want to watch t. v. have to come up with them and it's you just plug in it
D :  Mm mm mm mm
B :  Yeah
C :  And they can have all the control they want it
C :  We also have that this module for uh old people
C :  We big buttons here in other that and that
C :  It acts like the previous one you just plug in and
C :  It works
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah the idea you the the conceptual idea is that
B :  Simplicity and powerful
B :  Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons
B :  Powerful use that
B :  All the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings
B :  With lots of buttons
B :  But here you only have few buttons but you week and um the same powerful function and it is
B :  But in addition the simplicity
B :  So
B :  That's the best idea of the combat that's a lot
B :  And you know they show and um
B :  Uh in this uh design yeah
B :  Okay now we come that important features that i did not
B :  Tell you the first one is a speech recogniser i guess detachable or add on
B :  And then we also have security feature for example you see oh well well i i is there a bus them as had would be that some breaking the material what was the material again
D :  I
C :  The titanium and so it's very uh
B :  Determine the true
A :  Titanium
B :  Again uh i do that shit i've used uh it's a it's a and durable one again because is a a the trees you can choose that that's a better for you uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Leading the only be a good one but you can press it should go one again you pay for when you get
B :  And then uh um you get the point is a robust to misplace a remind us all
B :  When you finish watching a t. v.
B :  And you
B :  There you you to not the t. v.
B :  And and this is the message coming out that uh please put that back
B :  To the charger
B :  So
D :  Okay
B :  So that's p.
B :  Or is it that's the remind apart
B :  Yeah
B :  And um
B :  And also use the programmable channel and vocabulary so we didn't definable company so it's up to the use of the define
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So
B :  Sorry
B :  I and then uh uh because of the shoe because sure and uh using the device so
B :  We have also i appreciate the uh of t. v. programs by sean
B :  And this can be used by the outdoor by the sure and
B :  So
B :  You start using the channel you are choosing the t. v. contents of the night
B :  So
B :  It's pretty powerpoint that's that's i dunno buttons are at use because of this feature
B :  Yeah
B :  And and for the materials that is cheap to produce that thing uh it's quite clear uh form
A :  Right
B :  Yeah
B :  And also like do it and offencive designs
B :  Maybe again proved more the design
A :  What what's
A :  Maybe yeah
A :  What's the past six to produce
B :  And easier to
C :  Well so the price produce
B :  I
C :  For uh the simplest one and say are we start from four dollars to produce
C :  Such a device
C :  Uh it's about it
A :  With with with a
C :  No no we that we do the charger
D :  But it's i do it
A :  Okay
C :  So but uh well
C :  To the last to produce the the microphone and speech recognition systems
C :  Two dollars for the uh for that i don't know to use
C :  And finally three rows for the charger
C :  So if you uh sum up uh everything
A :  We don't have charger
C :  In the l. c. d.
C :  We discussed do that
B :  I
C :  You have to press for plus for plus two plus two
C :  I think it's about it
D :  I think you can use excel
A :  We don't have only option
C :  So the total cost if you if you want all the fiction functionalities will be about the fifteen that was
A :  Charles tell you don't entertain him
B :  Yeah
A :  Ah it's
C :  But
C :  It's just if you want all functionalities
A :  And we don't do it it'd be changed
C :  Excuse me
A :  It's better that way
A :  You should
D :  He has a nice inputs but we have um
D :  Either impose from the public demands i think we would just have a tough look and then we can
D :  Make all statements and we can finalise the product based on this this
D :  I think we can just want to my presentation and
D :  We can wind up
D :  Or we could do come to some a final conclusions
D :  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and this or some of the findings
D :  And um
D :  In the markets
D :  The people are not really interested with the l. c. d. without l. c. d. b. it's speech recognition
D :  Interface or that a speech resignation interface
D :  But also the people want that in touch it is a thing is they want to have and
D :  Fancy look-and-feel mm
D :  It's true very fancy with colourful
D :  And uh very handy to whole
D :  And the second thing is it should be much more technologically you know a two
D :  Of course in that
D :  We could put l. c. d. or recognition to be more technologically innovative
D :  And that the line is easy to use
C :  Well i think that the technical reading innovation is it is in the project itself since you haven't ship the remote
C :  Oh uh how do we need to choose uh interactively with the t. v. screen uh
C :  Uh oh we just for buttons
D :  Yeah and if we go to the next slide
D :  Here you can find these are the latest fashion updates
D :  And so this and paris and then and then also doubt detector this
D :  Trends
D :  That
D :  Above this year it's going to be in here all four corners table so people are really interested
D :  To see if they haven't read more in the shape of the fruit bowl of a stable or whatever the like
D :  So i think it should be
D :  Much more customised it's
D :  To make a different dutch shapes
D :  And the second thing is and if the material the really do not want it to be very hard as in the case of
D :  Ready to a plastic or titanium it should be some more spongy
B :  But um the problem is that the um
B :  Is it robust the mishandling
D :  Uh um
B :  We have you should find a material that is robust in the same time spongy
C :  A sponge
D :  Yeah so
B :  Spongy
D :  So finally we have this to be criterias
D :  One is fancy look
D :  So again is
D :  You know a two
D :  And thirties
D :  Easy to use
D :  So these are the of of the criteria out
D :  On which we are going to be a little remote
B :  Uh-huh
D :  So
D :  And we have an evaluation criteria for each one of this
D :  Say that
D :  We have a seven point scale
D :  From one to seven
B :  Uh-huh
D :  And for reach of the product
D :  You could just you made a scale
D :  According to this
B :  Uh-huh
D :  So now you have it l. c. d. and without l. c. d.
D :  So
D :  On the scale if it is true
D :  If it is
D :  If it has a fancy look you could just tell me one
D :  Or if it is false you do then it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy then you could just any seven
D :  So
D :  We can make a study on this and
B :  So is in give a legend depending
B :  On us or at the users
D :  Oh no we have you have designed to pour x. no one is that l. c. d. and it ought l. c. d.
B :  Well for will give the scoring uh we ourself or
A :  Oh you
D :  According to you
B :  Parties
D :  Not going to you would design us
D :  How do feel
D :  Does that uh with the l. c. d. and without l. c. d.
D :  Okay that does make this uh that
D :  And without l. c. d.
D :  One on the scale of the l. c. d.
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Remote control car the look how does it look like is it a very fancy or
D :  And look much fancy
C :  Why doesn't look much fun stage and say
C :  Three or four
D :  And you whatever for that
A :  And you
B :  I think we can improve on the design
C :  Yeah that's it
B :  And some of the store and comment that this is like uh the store the edge suffering
B :  I
B :  Design
B :  Um we had before goes all all this
B :  Time on be
C :  Technical aspect
B :  On the technical aspect functional aspects
B :  But also the simplicity
A :  Uh-huh
B :  As for the design maybe we should higher design a two
D :  So i take three on it the city
C :  Yeah it's three
D :  So without l. c. d. how would you rate it's
C :  Well for
D :  Four
C :  I think it's it's are more easy to make
C :  Fancy things when it's not complicated so
B :  Yeah
C :  Removing the l. c. d. um gives us uh
C :  Mm maury best see two
B :  Yeah
C :  Have a fancy look
D :  And in that sense off in a way to ness
D :  With the l. c. d.
C :  Well it's it's the same for both so uh i will give of five six
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Five a. l. c. d. and
C :  Well i'll fire also well
C :  Number and please
B :  From the you know there's an aspect i i feel that uh oh
B :  What is most you know that these
B :  Of a problem but compared to the existing problem but that we use all
B :  In the last meeting
B :  Is that are
B :  The retrieval of t. v. programs by content
B :  Because or or that it's really not that if
B :  And for now
B :  And and and innovation we have a simplicity and
B :  Simplicity
B :  Few buttons we've uh
B :  Mm
C :  Would that the functionalities
B :  And other functionalities
D :  So without l. c. d.
B :  Is there there is a for both
B :  I'll be i think that know a product is
B :  Oh oh has the best in law well there's a buy us a document
D :  No not going to design aspect we want to know
B :  Because we designed
D :  How would do feel innovativeness
B :  Uh and the innovation is is very high
D :  With the l. c. d.
A :  I see
D :  And without l. c. d.
C :  For both seats
B :  For both
C :  The same innovations yeah
B :  Is is an innovation
D :  Okay
B :  So maybe you can put six
C :  Uh uh six let's go for six
B :  It's uh
A :  Without l. c. d.
B :  Both
D :  No actually
D :  To make it with the l. c. d. you make more uh sorts so i had there is
D :  How you know it in s. included if we make it with the l. c. d. u. them in the days without l. c. d.
C :  Yeah
D :  That is not much you know it an s. so can you look
A :  No you know like yeah yeah
B :  Yeah that was that there was the issue is that
B :  What it what is the display on the l. c. d.
B :  We haven't really uh
C :  Okay but
D :  I mean that's what you are so that's what
B :  The the mean i actually it's the it's got an l. c. d. but what are the display on the l. c. d.
D :  Design
D :  No it's like this and then on the l. c. d.
D :  According to what i understand from a model is
A :  So that's remove it
D :  You have a joystick it up
B :  Yeah
D :  And you have a l. c. d.
D :  Yeah just press the joystick
D :  You get your a programme
B :  Yeah but
C :  Yeah but you have the same programme on the t. v. screen
D :  But then
B :  Yes
B :  Exactly
A :  This is the problem
D :  Well on the t. v. you don't it doesn't display on the t. v. now
C :  If you have the l. c. d. that
D :  Yeah city then they there is no meaning in having an on the t. v. or then again you have a channels volume on all the stuff
C :  Yeah
B :  But you cannot display all on the l. c. d.
D :  And whatever
D :  And the depends upon our design
D :  So
B :  And you have all for the users who for for l. c. d.
D :  I mean
B :  I will give the in the in give them the l. c. d. we give what the customer a
B :  Uh one sorry
C :  Yeah
D :  So
D :  Without l. c. d. you want to put that at the same
D :  No i love you know which are nice
D :  And which would you recommend easier to use with the l. c. or without l. c. d.
C :  But i think both so um
C :  Really easy to use because there are few weeks and the buttons
B :  Yeah
C :  And uh uh well the main you are here
B :  Yeah
C :  Well organised so
C :  Well we'd take them or knowing that technology you can you can easy to use the product so i would give it a six for the easy to use
B :  I think
A :  No it's
A :  Testifying
A :  I c. d.
A :  The
A :  The data
A :  I think it's better to do it without l. c. d.
B :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Because that's with the l. c. d. just increase the price
D :  Yeah
A :  I that i think that's a minute so
B :  Yeah
A :  Without the said it would be uh
D :  Or you can just go back to the previous slide know where we have we have if we walk that's
D :  So i mean in the part is and you could just a minute to make some thirteen euros so according to four corners table or a spongy that's
D :  Without l. c. d. and the door speech recognition you and then our product is going to be
C :  It's cheaper to produce
D :  But it does
D :  Yeah
B :  Hmm
C :  And uh you from the the uh well if we have less technology will more liberty to uh
D :  Yeah that's right
C :  For the shape and uh things like that so
B :  I have an ending the same
B :  About the easy to use aspect
B :  I think the easy to use uh
B :  I space different for different people
C :  Yeah
B :  For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they will be was a lot of control's a lot of buttons
B :  Four kids there wasn't a t. c. d.
B :  It's similar read for the old people they want simplicity so that's why we have the power and um audio
D :  Yeah yeah that's right
B :  Uh we can have the the more complex design used
B :  E. d. one it but
B :  But there are all
B :  What i'm trying to say here is that the um
B :  We have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people
B :  So we come so easy to use i think it's very use a customisable
B :  Use a custom mine is vision is very important yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  So
D :  So without the city
D :  I just a good five
A :  Hmm
D :  Or you want to to a six
C :  Six
B :  I think system
C :  Yes as you say it would but uh
A :  Without that c. d.
D :  So i i think it's better to have this
C :  Yeah
D :  Without l. c. d.
C :  And to improve the the
D :  As a programme manager's problem product minuses that without l. c. d. it is going to reduce the costs also
B :  Yeah
D :  And it's going to be much simpler to use
C :  Yes and to give a small ability to have a fancy look so mm
B :  Yeah
C :  So let's go back to our overall a battery uh-huh
B :  I think for for the design is is
D :  So
A :  But what about this the speech recognition
A :  And you what about the integration of
B :  The speech recogniser is a a normal do
A :  Is it okay
C :  Yeah
D :  There's going to an optional if someone wants to buy it
D :  They can have it otherwise no
A :  Uh so it's optional
D :  It's an option
B :  Yeah
C :  It's optional yeah
C :  Since well i i mean the this study yeah
C :  People are more had to like small to have a spongy yeah i remote control that i guess
A :  I think we all had identical
B :  I
D :  Yeah
A :  I think it should be better if we have all these want to use and the same remote control
A :  Because maybe that it's gonna do with these uh
D :  Yeah but you mind if you have and i don't
D :  That it's made just uh oh hide though didn't a model
A :  Uh
D :  And so the parents can't do that
A :  On that yeah
A :  How many times did
C :  Yeah
A :  Time for for get to have a
A :  Put it on so maybe but if you have one is the same
D :  In the same sets yeah
B :  Oh
D :  And then individual buttons to make them more
B :  The problem is t. v. we are bright if a custom oh no one's a certain component
B :  And the the one the parental control because it's a couple would not have sure and
B :  I mean you said the product of them i get you could make any kind of people
B :  And not all people would need all the functionalities we propose to them
B :  So we might lose a customer because of these
B :  I don't know what you can uh
A :  So you mean that even if this what it is p. b. b. function and that would be optional
B :  Yes
B :  What do you think i don't know yeah um i did a minute
D :  And then i do i don't have to make a marketing survey that
B :  Yeah
D :  Oh how many batteries couple or or many couples have a t. v. or to the number of singers to have a television
C :  Yeah
D :  So based on that i think
B :  Yeah
B :  But uh the question is and doesn't a small they're they're it the increase the production cost or decrease the production cost
C :  Well it's uh well the same because if
A :  I think this is
C :  Well you can these
C :  If you had or something like
A :  If you think is is
C :  Oh no because if you
C :  If you uh does something well mm yeah maybe because it's three different p. c.s uh to mm to be the bad
A :  Hmm
D :  But you can make it on a single p. c. fit the different options
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah it's so i think it's cheap very few mm if you already been to the one that
C :  Functionalities uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
C :  On the same at your uh huh
D :  On the same p. c. yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  That would get that thing is that if in d. you when they had uh existing provide you you gonna maintained e. d. u. gonna keep the same customer
D :  Yeah
B :  Because the same customer will come back to buy at the at once
D :  Yeah that's right so how many to the scroll where the time options and that's
B :  So so
B :  Yeah you so you've done them by now they can buy in the future
D :  And
B :  So in that way you actually keeping the cast the same custom uh editing them to come banging again
B :  Mm again
B :  I
D :  Yeah something like uh microsoft for us
C :  I
B :  I
B :  When a child of all the microsoft
D :  I
A :  I think maybe we don't want that
B :  And we do one does them we
D :  No
D :  And that's and we sell it you make of this and sell it on this
B :  Yeah
B :  But you the buyers can be out that would be it can be upgraded be a good thing i i
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah that depends on the eye
D :  And uh was idea what uh
D :  The shape of the remote controls
D :  Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable rights
C :  Oh so
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Bill require different types of p. c. v. s. i.
C :  I think that
C :  Yeah but so uh and also the um mm well the components we'll have to change because uh
C :  We have to deal with the shape than that but i don't think it will uh increase the cost much
D :  All it will be like this to the p. c. b. would be the same for all it but only the exterior
D :  Chip is different for all
C :  No one but it's a bit complicated two we she's if you need machines two different machines to um i'll have
B :  Yeah
B :  Well we can change used to propose the customers we've
B :  Teams
B :  For example would be the mobile phones now i think it's a different kinds of scheme in in people's this to the all i have a new screen and that's that the
D :  Yeah yeah that's right
C :  Yeah yeah we're gonna have the same double shape and then uh i've done the schemes and we
B :  Yeah
