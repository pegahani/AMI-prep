A :  Mm
B :  Mm
A :  This is a brief facial expressions of if i
B :  Okay yeah
A :  It's forever it's not real
B :  Yeah that's okay
A :  Okay
B :  That's okay
D :  Mm
A :  Yeah
A :  You gonna be the first one on powerpoint so
B :  Okay
A :  What is the cookie what the uh
A :  Yeah my starting out
A :  Any that
A :  Oh sorry if okay um
A :  Right welcome back
A :  For our to the second meeting
A :  And sam i'll be happy to to have the last thirty minutes
A :  Um
A :  And sanitation minutes on this one and and down
A :  Being don't touch the powerpoint for at this meeting is in very necessary for
A :  Uh myself because it'll be more about
A :  How what you guys are printing
A :  To the meeting today
A :  Um
A :  So
A :  The first presentation will be looking at is poppies presentation
A :  And um
A :  So
A :  Right so um take it away party
B :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  The needed
A :  It's it's plugged in so um
C :  He looks at it
B :  I have uh okay
B :  And sure that sorry about this guy is
A :  Don't know
B :  That's as well
B :  Right yeah
B :  Okay i'll take this time just to apologise i i wouldn't he uh
B :  Receive my emails later on
B :  There was too busy carry do it
B :  Do you mind thing which is obviously not a very good of a teamworking think that there we go
A :  I'm sure it's a
B :  Um
B :  So i was looking at
B :  How are we gonna go about the working design and what we actually
B :  Need to do um what's be
B :  Remote control needs of it and it meets the um
B :  I'll i'll a person to have a portable does that device so they can control the television from wherever they are they don't need to actually manually touch the television set
B :  So it gives them much more flexibility in an open to be where they want to be
B :  Um from
B :  Uh on the functional side of things i found out that while from a previous meeting we decided that there's certain points do make a product unique
B :  Um one
B :  It's the visibility
B :  In the dark which is
B :  Um genevieve idea
B :  So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically or we could use it only related buttons which we're all familiar with when we using a mobile phone or
B :  Um something for that for many l. also matically um lights at that
B :  First touch
B :  All we could use fluorescent materials which would just
B :  Take in the light during the day in and as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark
B :  Um also we could use um and the alarm
B :  So if we lost be
B :  Um remote control perhaps the could be a bus and on the television set itself which you can press
B :  And then along from the hands that would sound where it was hopefully in the room
B :  Maybe behind the question of somewhere
B :  Um hum so that would work um
B :  Go back there
B :  Um and other thing i think we we we may styles on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of a design
B :  Um
B :  From previous researchers have hard on some other projects
B :  Um with leds about smart materials flat um
B :  Um specific how ease of medals
B :  Have a shape memories so they can be he sits and um
B :  And called and then you change shape of
B :  Um
B :  The metal so it for example the screen that's holding something together could expand then it would force all the components that part
B :  So um the benefits of this a product to be that when it came c. n. do this product live
B :  If it was heated
B :  Um everything with spring apart so all the um individual components could be easily separated and and some could be we used some could be recycled and i think that be very important to products now especially "'cause" is so much a responsibility for
B :  All the um companies are coming up with
B :  Make new designs "'cause" all we all know that our results is a big name at it and
B :  Have to be very environmentally conscious
A :  Right um one question of this sounds a construct a ball um metal it allows for
A :  Recycling materials so that um someone could have this product for as long as they felt
B :  Um
A :  That they wanted it and then once they contributed then
B :  And then
A :  That company can break down the part the parts better
B :  Yeah
B :  Yep day with
B :  I mean you would make
B :  It be
B :  The product as
B :  You normally would apart from there
B :  That that's that hold altogether would be made out of the shape than reality
B :  And that's the part
B :  That it's woods
B :  Um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end maybe use it would put and that
B :  Project to to the company
B :  "'cause" this product responsibility to get rid of what they've made
B :  Um and then the company it then
B :  Just use that make use of this shape memory i know these two
B :  Is this that
B :  The uh
B :  We've heard of that and then i do we use "'em" bits and uh that's it draws you can wear out with time all not usable they might be like
A :  Yeah
B :  Bill that's going to scrap metal something like the case if it's scratch does anyone wants we use it but you might be able to market down and
A :  Uh-huh
B :  These are you can somewhere else
A :  Would we be the company that was a breakdown of these so um medals or would we
B :  You could we could probably m. m. i. employee uh aside company or something to do that for as they would be a responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we make it
A :  Contribute other
B :  President percentage at least not have we not hundred percent and everything we could do
A :  Right
A :  Okay the sounds like a really great idea one thing we have to consider is our um one hundred percent
A :  Um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Um so we'll have to investigate
A :  How much that will cost us cost the company
A :  Um "'cause" it sounds very labour intensive we have to hire number of people
A :  And they might be more expense of
B :  Well at the fact of these shape memory i know it is that they they don't need to be manually
B :  The um be constructed like you don't have to
B :  Individually um and screw all the scripts because of this uh properties the smart material
A :  Uh-huh
B :  All you need is just a he so they self destruct and cells
A :  Alright also have to investigate the financial implications
B :  So isolated as a like a high comes out that you know highly uh a quality machinery in for a specific machinery that
A :  Right i like the environmental approach um i have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well
B :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  Also
B :  There's um components is will be how with the wheel actually work let's have a put this plan to get the uh
A :  And so could you
B :  Ago
B :  Very shy go back
A :  Those are um
B :  It's it would actually sure the circuit diagram
B :  Although i haven't come up with the final
B :  So okay yep
A :  Okay
B :  Sides that would call those components in
A :  So those are what um
A :  Construct the remote of the of the
B :  Yeah but just raise what's the energy source it could be a battery like rechargeable probably
B :  Um and
B :  Yeah well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to
B :  Be received by the chip on television set it up
A :  Alright great
B :  Okay
B :  The notes f. eight again to you escape so
B :  There you go
B :  Okay
A :  Alright thank you very much
A :  And sound next presenter will be tar uh
B :  Yeah
C :  Nice
B :  For
C :  Is it
C :  Function f. eight yeah
D :  Uh-huh function f. eight
A :  Function f. eight sorry
C :  Oh right okay
D :  Uh that's right
A :  Yeah
C :  Okay
C :  I am the user
C :  Um
C :  User interface designer
C :  The technical functions design of the apparatus is the fact the apparatus should have
C :  And in this case it's a function of remote
C :  Control which is to send messages to the television television set
C :  I take inspiration from although similar designed
C :  That rank up with a directional trendy remote control which is celp or international
C :  They're to be functional design options
C :  A multifunctional remote control
C :  Which can be used for several entertainment devices
C :  And the single function remote control
C :  You specifically for the television
D :  That's or was that last multifunctional and
C :  Sorry um a single function just the television
C :  Stuff
D :  Oh i see
C :  Um
C :  Multi function controls
C :  Can be difficult to use as a lot shape of buttons can be confusing
C :  A single function remote control is
C :  Some place to use but it means you have to have all their remote controls
C :  We're all there and chi minh devices
C :  Um
C :  I think that
C :  Single function remote control would be preferable
C :  Because it's easier to use
C :  It be more compatible with the range of television sets making it more
C :  Internationally sellable
C :  Um i will make
C :  And every so slightly more obtainable
C :  As we have less function on the side of things to include in the design
C :  I'm not be more profitable have a bit more simplistic
C :  And last functions we have to be included
C :  So be cheaper to make
C :  I'm probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with
C :  A wider range of devices
C :  Does anyone have any question
D :  Uh-huh
D :  So as far as we know um a single function television remote control is is is usable internationally
C :  Well it's just that one we are creating that we and we have to make at um
C :  Compatible with different
C :  Branson
C :  Devices
C :  And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices well it and
C :  Older and uh yeah
D :  D. v. d.s and these
A :  Right
C :  Right mm
A :  Does everyone agree with this does anyone
A :  Object and and find be multifunctional might be a better way to go
B :  Um
B :  Mm i was just wondering about the
B :  Well what can we said before about having like some hidden control so it coming out the casing
B :  That would probably
B :  Um
B :  Wall what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design as well as having that would complicated a lot more
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah and then it designing only
D :  I think i agree with the signal design thing for now because or try to do so much that if we can make a unique user-friendly a red and it's also a lot of also on multifunctional
B :  Yeah
D :  Um we gonna go over budget one
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah that's true
C :  Yeah
C :  And with this will have more room in the project folder to make
C :  Um more original design
C :  We'll have more money t.
A :  Yeah
C :  Cool and the design side of it
B :  Okay
A :  Right
A :  Sounds good
A :  Alright well um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Are you ready for all your presentations uh
D :  Yes yeah
A :  That that's
A :  Except you know looked up to the
D :  I'm not not a banana
A :  I
D :  Completely ready
A :  Great
D :  Oh
D :  Oh it's lost my microphone
A :  Right no problem we can
D :  Just a moment
D :  Okay so i'll be discussing be functional requirements of this remote control
D :  Um i'm not a real a briefing on what that means exactly
D :  Um
D :  If you remember from the email we got for a very first uh kick-off meeting with the coffee machine the functional requirements of that was to produce have coffee quickly
D :  Um so what are we talking when i was equivalent for remote control
D :  Um so basically what needs and desires are to be for felt
D :  Um i've done some marketing research lot of interviews with remote control users
D :  Um and some internet research i'm not sure you my findings
D :  Oh and first i want to remind you about our company motto on purpose so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products
D :  Um answer motto we put the fashion in electronics
D :  So i think that should be a priority here
D :  Um
D :  And we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design a just an electronic fashion so that it's something that fits in the household
A :  And say was that last thing you just said
D :  Um we should be looking towards trends in both closing in interior design
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Any trends that are going on in in the public even be the uh you know who's famous for t. v. shows are being watched
D :  Um to influence uh remote control
D :  Okay so the findings
D :  Um seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly which is a quite a significant number
D :  Um the other twenty five percent didn't specify the feel of them are fun and you know control
D :  Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
D :  Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
A :  And say the eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking uh remote control
D :  Yep they're willing
D :  The willing to spend money on a remote control personality as opposed to a basic you know of all black
A :  Okay
D :  All same size but in remote control
D :  Um so this something that people care but it's not it's it's not ignore in the household
D :  Um sandy five percent of remote control users said they zap a lot zapping meeting because the channels a lot there
D :  You know a masters
D :  Um and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons
D :  Very small amounts
D :  That that was interesting
A :  Right so might be very appealing of um
B :  So the single
A :  We have very concise
A :  Buttons and another thing with um lots of surfing
A :  But we have to work on something that could be
A :  Um
A :  A lot more durable because that's fine with um
A :  Channel changers that um a lot of the numbers game rub down if they're printed on the button
D :  Yes
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  And actually go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of each of the buttons how much they used and uh how important that uh users find them so the power button and obviously in in ours only used once or put this is a turning on off the t. v.
D :  Um but the relevance of that button is nine and ten
D :  So people want gotta turn on the t. v.
D :  With the remote control
D :  Um
D :  As was standing up and
D :  Turning on television set channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour that's a huge about this is the most important but in
D :  Um it's obvious in in commercials come on the changing it so as you said we wanna durable but in that's not gonna write down
D :  Well then so that that and our users found was that ten
D :  Ten of ten
D :  Uh i dunno for volume selection to ten and ten
D :  And it's used on average four times an hour
D :  Not as much as channel selection but still significant
D :  Um audio settings is use an average your point eight times an hour relevance is to
D :  Screen settings which means brightness colour cetera zero point five times an hour
D :  Um and relevance of one point five for getting specific statistics yeah
D :  Teletext um no i'm not too clear what that is and if you can tell me flipping pages
C :  It's um
D :  Is that
B :  We can use like
C :  It has a t. v. has like information has information on holidays then use entertainment
A :  Yeah
D :  So like a running banner underneath
A :  It's um
A :  No it's a button that you press the menu uh at the menu pops up having is to do for the
C :  No that yeah
D :  Um
C :  And you have page numbers like
C :  For the menu and you press
C :  The page numbers with remote tuned
D :  Okay
B :  Very basic in that
C :  Come on
C :  Very basic and tonight yeah but you have
B :  Um
D :  Okay but also the weather and okay
C :  He happy you have no objection back with it you know like that i can send email from you know actor
B :  Yeah
B :  Information that on like television timetables what's on
B :  From now on that on every time
C :  Yeah
D :  Right well i guess i'm not with that because i wasn't but it's it's being used fourteen times an hour um and as about high relevance a six point five to looks like something that we're gonna wanna do some research on in include
C :  Yeah
D :  On our remote control
D :  Um channel settings three or point zero one times an hour relevance of three
D :  Channel settings
C :  Power which is chairman the channels
D :  But it's very changing channels
C :  Could be
C :  To the them and at the very start you know if you continue to use that each and all the time
D :  Oh okay
C :  He's do you think yeah yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  And so it's not use very often that was to find it well that's
D :  Okay
D :  Um biggest frustrations of um
D :  The people that we interviewed remote controls are often lost somewhere so those are discuss with poppy how we can have a a an alarm system
D :  So that people can find it
D :  Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control so it should be very user-friendly you know people know what to do very quickly
D :  Um
D :  Remote controls are bad for r. s. i.
C :  Prepared
B :  The strain injury
D :  Ah
B :  I think
D :  So those people than for instance that's
A :  That's rather sad
A :  Oh
D :  Um maybe are
B :  Oh i'm guessing that uh
C :  Yeah yeah i think it has
D :  Designers can look into that um
B :  Mm
D :  But ins that's don't require you know very for a shame if they respond
B :  Yeah
D :  Double have to also avoid you know parents responded to the slightest touches well that's a problem
B :  Yeah
D :  Okay you guys are get that one down
A :  Yep
D :  Um
D :  Okay here's some ideas for you a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls so i'll show you some numbers here
D :  Um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five ninety one point two percent so that they would pay extra might have voice rec voice recognition include on the remote control
D :  Um you could see the number decreases
D :  Uh that's with all its uh interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount
D :  Um that would are willing to pay extra
D :  So i guess we're not to figure out what age group we're we're targeting in it and have voice recognition or something wanna look into
D :  And if we have the budget for it
D :  Um if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off thing is ninety percent overnight percent before
A :  I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Um financially and and functionally
A :  Um
A :  And especially if we are um trying to be trendy go with fashions
A :  Things like that um ages like from thirty five to sixty five or shall or numbers
A :  Probably won't be
A :  As concerned
D :  So that that's a whole other field of research i dunno fit be if it's to have a remote if you're talking to a television and saying change channel
D :  Um and very handy members you haven't household so in in may be too complicated for us but something to keep in mind anyway
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  And something that like for the complicate is that the t. v. makes was itself
D :  Right
A :  Wonder if you have
C :  Yeah
B :  And this is conversation
B :  And then we aim at the same time
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
B :  Although
B :  And we we tend to be when you're watching television but
B :  Okay
A :  Yeah
B :  Could be very difficult to get the specific
A :  Yeah if we looking for simplistic design of
D :  Uh-huh
A :  We need to decide if that is are um
A :  Intention is is is to stick design
A :  Um
A :  Because if
A :  If it is than i think for is um voice activated
D :  It looks like
A :  Yeah and i was sort of negate the whole remote control thing because of people can activate
D :  Uh-huh
A :  The television with their voice and they will be using them
D :  Be like the alternate remote
A :  They won't be talking it remote sure
D :  Um
D :  Okay in the last thing here was that an l. c. d. screen so i mean voice recognition might be a lot too extreme for us not practical
D :  Um an l. c. d. screen though might be something that's you know you can shift two pages kind of all the way this powerpoint is working
D :  So they don't have so many buttons to deal with
A :  I'm i dunno an l. c. d. screen is
D :  Oh sorry just just a screen like a computer screen
D :  So or like um
C :  No but from
D :  Yeah or like an alarm clock you have an l. c. d. verses just uh
B :  What what would it be on the screen
D :  Normal core
A :  I've no idea still so that
D :  All just like an electronic screen as opposed to just balance it be like a little
A :  All on the remote oh okay
D :  Like an yep
D :  Like on the top of the cell phone that the law c. d. screen
A :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  That's why i dunno what exactly we put on there i guess the channel that you're a line of what the volume setting
C :  Yeah
C :  "'cause" it that it would be good if it had that to programme that was a know what was next that that would probably be
B :  Like getting thing with the tell you that
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah that would be good yeah
B :  Also so like and
B :  Teletext of does that are having
C :  Yeah
B :  The
B :  So i thought three times
C :  Might be quite expensive to to that
B :  Mm
B :  He
A :  Right
D :  I guess that's something we cannot take back to respect the research
D :  Um and finally oops
D :  My personal preferences and parts um i think a party really should be unique design
D :  Um we want to know people want their home every remote control looks the same so
D :  Uh in my can eat it should be um user friendly and unique
D :  So the other stuff might be able to a lotta gadgety for some people
D :  Um i i myself voice recognition kind of scares me off
D :  So for a framing to make this an international university universally accepted product
D :  Um and for all the other thing is age market i mean if we want to concentrate on fifteen or twenty five else we could go with the fancy stuff
D :  But if we wanna make fifty million and and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
D :  Stick to the basics
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Can we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend remote control like their priorities might not be offencive remote control when
D :  Uh-huh
C :  They're just start night mm
D :  Right way to keep in mind the the reliability of our research i mean you know a sixteen oh boy would say you had pay extra for voice recognition intel be realise that's the remote slides
C :  Yeah
C :  Oh
C :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  So i think i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more
C :  Early twenties
A :  Yeah
C :  I mean it's
A :  And if one of the largest
A :  Power or
A :  Most complain about thing is that
A :  It takes so long to get to know how to use remote control i'm sure that something like an l. c. d. screen or a remote control would be
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  That's for the ring that problem
B :  Yeah
B :  Okay
A :  Yeah
C :  Mm
B :  Okay thank you
A :  Alright
D :  Okay that's it for the market research
A :  Okay
A :  Before we go into
A :  Um more discussion on
A :  We want
A :  This design to look like i have to see some information from the management
A :  That will fact some of our decisions
A :  Um for one thing because
A :  Having controls with d. v. d. v. c. r. that sort of thing would really complicated design
A :  Of the remote control
A :  Um
A :  We've decided not to include them and make it a specific
A :  Just a specific television um function
A :  Which is good as as we've sort of decided that
A :  We would like to go with that anyway
A :  Um for many reasons so um
A :  Yeah that decision sort of need for us
A :  Another thing that might say um
A :  A fact other decisions is that um
A :  The management feels that teletext is outdated
A :  Because more people using the internet now
A :  And so um we want concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option
B :  Can i just injury
B :  Which like that like in
D :  Yeah maybe we can do the
B :  You all
A :  Okay sure
B :  I've you've got a powerpoint on that
A :  Yeah handy i'm looking at
A :  The kinetic right now
A :  Okay thank you
D :  Oh come back screen
B :  Where they was the management suggesting use of the internet about the teletext so just avoiding both altogether
A :  Um oh well
A :  I mean we don't have
A :  The recesses or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control but um
B :  Yeah
A :  They would just pretty much saying that
B :  Okay
A :  The teletext would not be used
B :  Mm "'kay"
A :  Right and another thing this for the design
A :  The design of the product is that
A :  Um we wanna create
A :  Um
A :  More sense that people know that this
A :  It's from our company
A :  So um all the remote controls must have r.
A :  Um well incorporate our logo and colour in in some way
A :  So it um
A :  Perhaps um our logo on the bottom or were for you feel like you good
A :  Um it doesn't have to be the colour
A :  Of our um
A :  Of our company buy another thing is that um
A :  We need to we probably would have to
A :  Have that colour in and logo decided upon
A :  Um
A :  I'm assuming that we are you have one back
A :  For the purposes of this meeting um i wasn't offered a
A :  I had a type of logo what colour so
B :  Okay we can
A :  If i could be um some more on the design so we can be recognisable
D :  And spray are are are in yellow
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  The little r. r. yellow thing okay
C :  Yeah
A :  Real reaction
A :  Okay
A :  Um i guess those are the changes
A :  Um
A :  So now we need to discuss
A :  Um
A :  And come to a decision on our remote control functions
A :  Of of have is going to be i'm just gonna look at my notes for a second
A :  Um we have to decide on a target group
A :  And the functions of the remote control so
A :  Um we are you know that it'll just be for the television it will be one have teletext
A :  But um
A :  You know we should discuss some those other options that you product genevieve
B :  That's that's case and saying
D :  Okay so i are we going to write off the l. c. d. option
A :  So most people feel about that
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  So no l. c. d.
D :  No teletext and no voice recognition
C :  I think a benign though if i can use as it's not much but if it was on your t. v. you ought to be able to use it
A :  Yeah but another thing is that if we're reaching international crowd
A :  Um
A :  I know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext would be really superfluous
B :  Yeah
C :  Alright
A :  Yeah i don't know but other countries besides the u. k. i. d. know if anywhere else
C :  If you mm
B :  I don't know
A :  Has it
C :  Mm
B :  More research like i think uh huh huh
A :  Alright
B :  That's if it was the m. management decision that we have a okay so
A :  It was a management decisions so it's it's pretty much out of our hands at this point
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
C :  Okay
A :  So i guess we looking at something rather simple
D :  Um my guest as for my findings looks that one minimise buttons
B :  "'kay"
D :  Um
B :  No
D :  And that was the where the use of find ability is important
B :  Hey hey
A :  Yeah i think we should definitely go ahead with you i was just an idea that you know
C :  Yeah
A :  "'cause" i'm sure that could be as in expensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
B :  Yeah the same signalling
A :  The same signal three then you could just like
A :  Make a little beeping noise is not that expensive to do
B :  Or a vibe parade just the same as the mobile phone make key just a
A :  Yeah
B :  It doesn't
A :  Yeah okay i like that idea
C :  Which should be able to you um have the little device anywhere
C :  As in our remote control for
C :  All t. v.s so
B :  If
C :  You can
B :  But do you mean the the link between the
C :  Yeah but my prayer
A :  Yeah the button all all
B :  If the button was actually on
C :  Yeah
B :  Oh yeah yeah mm
C :  Oh well okay yeah
A :  My third you'd still there
C :  Applicable to one t. v. set so we need to decide like you
B :  Maybe yeah yeah maybe selling adhesive that you could x. to come to the back of any set that would be
C :  Texting or or something
A :  Yeah i'd have to
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um yeah not
B :  Very intrusive all the seasoning small that's yeah that's a good thing
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah but it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use
A :  Would be what is the same reception on the remote control i guess but the actual device would have to have it so
B :  Yeah
A :  Infrared signal or okay
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah okay
C :  But need a battery
A :  Maybe um
B :  Probably
A :  Probably i mean
B :  Unless they could be
A :  That's your department a half
A :  Sort that out
B :  Oh okay yeah um
B :  Unless some way it could have some universal connection to like the stock at the same socket that the t. v.s
B :  Supplied from i mean the power for the t. v. so
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  That uh yeah you have to that's true
B :  More is that is that what yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Do some research and then right
A :  Great
A :  Um
A :  Alright and i'm sure that um
A :  Um the glow in the dark fluorescent
A :  Whatever system
A :  Um it's go ahead does everyone interest and uh
D :  The buttons
C :  I i like the like a suggestion i think that would be better "'cause" uh a fluorescent lights of these there
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Bright but after certain times two
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  But it doesn't it could be could be attacked a thing as well
D :  Um right if we're for minimise it but in it's not gonna make them actually larger and there's something on its you know
B :  To raise
D :  Up arrow down arrow for for volume
D :  Um and i dunno what we could do for for channels
D :  It's
C :  Was just the numbers could be embossed could be like greatest
D :  The numbers and cells that but then you'd like a pattern and down button for the channel channel changing
C :  Yeah could be race
C :  Just a little uh
C :  We could feel
B :  Yeah
A :  Mm
D :  It just that the that it be might be second one battery power if there if it is a light up i'm not sure
C :  Yeah
B :  That's true
A :  Yeah
B :  And also uh i have a you have to before um like
A :  They mean
B :  How it should be accessible to everybody
A :  Yeah
B :  And so that big
B :  Um buttons think for people are officially and had to go in the dark uh like that point make any difference anyway so like you to attack that might be better because
C :  Yeah
C :  Good yeah
B :  Have been more visible to
A :  Yeah
B :  Everybody
A :  Could we saw a week me possibly sorry to incorporate them both so that
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  The buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers and cells and be made out of some sort of well the dark material
C :  Yeah
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
A :  Is that i don't think that will go to g. real
A :  Um like the actual soft plastic
A :  Um cost that much more
A :  Another colours
B :  No it's not these days and it's quite easy
A :  Yeah
D :  I guess the other option refer to the batteries thing is you know how cellphones want to light up for fifteen seconds or something when years
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah that's good idea
D :  And then it goes to so if if you like changing the volume doing a movie and uh i'm thinking of was to be watching the beach or all the lights off right
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  You don't turn on the lights up to turn it down as a selling explosion in is can we get the baby
C :  Huh
D :  Um so if you touch the button a kind of reactivate so the lights up for
C :  That yeah that's good idea
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  And software
B :  It's a soft and nineteen
A :  Uh we have five minutes left
B :  Um
A :  Um for the meeting but i think we should discuss this light
A :  So just a little bit more before we close
A :  Um what was
A :  I missed the last moment reading that what we're talking about with the lighting up
A :  But um it's
D :  Oh oh this is the same the same way that the cell in a cellphone a light up for about ten fifteen seconds retouchable and after i mean not touch it for a while
A :  Yeah
D :  Um if instead of a constant light up on the on the remote control thing lights up for ten seconds when it's touch to get
A :  Mm also could be any button that would be pressed
D :  Yeah yeah you tested and it just kind of lights up then it gives the thing close of you have all the lights off in your living room
B :  Yeah
B :  It's a self time
A :  Yeah
D :  You'll be all temporally see it because is you know filling out what it for more than what ten seconds
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Okay so
B :  Yeah
A :  That's probably feasible so you did we should do the lighting up thing and the glow in the dark being and the shape of the numbers that are kind of decide what we're gonna do with this
B :  I think the shape of them is really good idea
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah okay
B :  And i think that's a unique as well i mean i haven't seen
C :  For for a silly and
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  And as you say make numbers can wear off if that is sort of
A :  Yeah
B :  People "'cause" i mean it printed yeah
A :  Yeah any could maybe of us if it's that softer rubber material be
A :  Um
A :  Uh better for people with um else know what's it called
B :  Hmmm sure
A :  R. s. i. what was that that wouldn't work
B :  Oh yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Oh right yeah
A :  Yep
B :  Yeah yeah repetitive strain
A :  Yes of like a hard buttons okay
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Um
A :  Did we want to go for uh the glow in the dark luck
A :  Or do we want to go for the lighting up in something like to do both are we could have or the other because it might
A :  For for design purposes i mean the lighting of thing might be better because
A :  Well the dark material has a funny kind of colour and a might not
D :  I was gonna say it
A :  Go with different like face plate so we make a lot of
D :  Exactly it did they might be perceived as tacky on the dark it's kinda like e. d.s neon style
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah and we should
D :  Um ways are gonna be trendy fashionable so
B :  Yeah that now they'll it's a huge range of different colours they could light up and as well which could again could make the company colours you could do we know yellow
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Right
B :  And like we just limited to would be just told me it's best so
A :  Right
A :  Right so the so the lighting up
C :  I was thinking of was cool in the dark you get the um
A :  Things
C :  Real reaction some ball at school in the dark and then it would be constantly uh put rice
B :  Yeah every time
D :  Mm
B :  But they're still is that the u. that could light up as well
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah i was that yeah
B :  All all of what
A :  Yeah mm the with the same thing i mean if you touch the button and then it could be
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  Okay
A :  It could be laid up as well
A :  Is
A :  Are you okay with that okay cool
A :  Um
A :  Alright so i think that um
A :  The completes most of our um
A :  Are more uh practical decisions an outside to designing
A :  And um making sure this can be feasible
D :  Um
A :  And given me
D :  Oh sorry
A :  Thing
A :  Did you say
D :  Yeah well i was gonna draw out there that thought about um
D :  Personalising the remote control
D :  Um
D :  It you "'cause" you mention face plates
D :  So i i dunno if there's something that
D :  Different you know like five different face plates end of this to start making more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the of the remote
B :  Okay like you can have changeable
C :  Oh yeah
D :  Um
C :  Interchangeable
B :  Um no but covers or something
D :  Yeah i can i
A :  Like an ipod or something
C :  That would be chaos yeah
B :  Yeah uh
D :  Exactly like an ipod exactly or or like a mobile off
A :  Okay
B :  Okay
A :  What does cell phone yeah
D :  And i dunno if you wanna go with you know t. v. show themes or something like a bart simpson face plates
C :  Yeah
C :  And then that would be
C :  More profit well like as a sideline to the remote
B :  Right so mm
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Could buy extra
A :  Sensors
D :  Exactly you could start off with three enough if we had a big then we can add someone
B :  Yes mm
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah that's right
C :  That's good yeah
A :  Yeah i think that we should incorporate that
B :  Interchangeable
B :  And also
A :  "'cause" i wouldn't be very expensive or are you just get one mold
C :  No
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Mm
A :  Person plus again and you know
B :  And also possible i mean it
B :  We could
B :  "'kay" you know also that by advertising certain t. v. shows but
C :  Oh yeah
A :  Yeah all that might be cut problematic with um copy reddish it's so
B :  Yeah but if we would pay is
A :  If it takes off then all will
B :  Yeah we could
A :  We'll try that out
B :  Um the environmental fact we can bring that up again
A :  Right we'll have to do more research
A :  But as of yet that has nothing to do with um
A :  The way luck
A :  Um does need to be beach to do do we need to reach a decision on that right now
B :  Um i've
A :  Because we need to investigate the financial implications
B :  Okay
A :  Okay
B :  That's
A :  Is it does it need to be uh
A :  Decided on our or should we
B :  I think we can probably leave that to later on
A :  Okay
A :  Great
A :  Ah right than anyone else have anything more to say before we close
B :  No
A :  Alright well
A :  Let's have lunch in will discuss a slide or
C :  Okay
B :  Okay thank you
A :  Alright
