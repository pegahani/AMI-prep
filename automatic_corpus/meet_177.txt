A :  Yeah
C :  Oh
B :  Okay
C :  Mm
A :  Three
A :  Wants to take notes
A :  Today
D :  Well
D :  Oh
A :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
A :  Okay
B :  Okay uh-huh
A :  Huh
D :  Mm "'kay" like to come to some yes
A :  But
D :  But it has to send
A :  Okay
D :  Yes yes yes yes
A :  Only kind of drinks
D :  Um
D :  Is it is first and just for that are really
D :  Sort of brief
D :  Um
D :  Version of what we have to do
A :  Yeah
D :  Hmmm which is
A :  Thank you
A :  Very interesting started the meeting
B :  Okay
C :  I
A :  Yeah once we've been and
C :  A bit
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh huh mine
D :  Actually that i was just talking one strategy uh documents at all
D :  Whatever
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Yeah true thing
B :  Okay yep
D :  Okay okay
B :  But you know it's fine
D :  Hmm
C :  Is it
D :  I'm sure sure sure
C :  Oh that's a sign or
A :  I have yep uh-huh
C :  And
D :  Mm "'kay"
C :  Oh shut
C :  If we need the outline of the prototype i mean what what we're gonna put and uh
D :  Well just sort of well the thing is yeah we're gonna be talking all of trained on the part for the progress and putting a screen shot some of us yeah okay
C :  Yeah because i mean that's basically what we doing here is not the hall
D :  Yeah also something that you mentioned in the um
D :  The previous
D :  Like just to sort of have a prototype together as well just saying that yeah we could potentially do that
B :  Yeah we could
D :  It's not something you have to
B :  This this could be just some of the school just
B :  Just describe some
B :  Screen shots some
D :  Yeah sure but the thing is i was thinking even less of browsing i mean just throw the screen shots in there
D :  When you talk about what you're doing it
B :  Yeah you can either have a wiki signal that that we can uh
D :  You can make sense
D :  So yeah oh yes yeah well actually have a habit it's very and screen shots but the control on this page so it's
A :  Uh-huh
D :  An email and so
B :  Yeah you can have that you know it's a screen shot and stuff would give us crucial as part of the in each one or um
B :  I've just a bunch of them in one session
D :  Anyway so um so yeah this just very general structure um i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and
D :  And uh
B :  Yeah
B :  Cover the topic segmentation one
D :  Right cool
C :  Yeah
D :  Nice
D :  Um so there's there's other stuff do you think should be don't that's a good example for any let you guys
D :  Otherwise
B :  Has to do it
D :  Um that someone else wanna sort you actually control is still throw together if you want
D :  Um put your person to into this one
B :  They've been elicited
A :  I
D :  And a perfectionist right
C :  Yeah
C :  Yes
B :  I i have
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  I
D :  A good idea it's it's good to know manny i
C :  Yeah
A :  Mm it's a nice have the i i i
B :  I i
C :  I
C :  I
D :  I
B :  I
C :  Is it
A :  And i mean like i don't know how
B :  A relatively i
A :  Mother and maybe speaker of english but i think it's it's a
A :  Yeah or
C :  Mm
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah well i mean is up to you if you wanna keep them and uh i'm happy to do some as well um last time tonight
A :  Well see
C :  Um and then
C :  Oh we'll send it to you in
B :  You can you can
A :  I
D :  Uh-huh
C :  You can get the final result
A :  Yeah
B :  Perfect yeah and i
C :  And so
A :  I look at it make it a one of my if you show working hours are like
A :  From talk walked up
A :  Three o'clock or something so if you can work and i that i i think
C :  I i call it a lot i i
D :  I
B :  I
C :  No if you buy a ticket but what i get a better like one you'll still am i
A :  I
C :  I
B :  Sleep slave we went through
D :  We just leave your computer and maybe if i want and a nice
C :  I would tend always be the yeah right
B :  I
A :  No actually no i
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah so maybe
A :  But i've never on line and morning so i
D :  Yeah actually notice that no one else
C :  Yeah i i
C :  I
B :  I
A :  Mm
D :  Yes
C :  The
D :  Alright
A :  Yeah
C :  So
D :  Okay so i'll send it a two and um
A :  Well
A :  Yeah do it you wanna do it first and then now i think it
D :  Okay
B :  It's have a charger i
A :  Yeah i i i i
C :  Yeah
D :  Actually um
A :  I'll i'll send it out to you again i
B :  I think
D :  Was anything else we want it at the time line i mean essentially was what like
A :  Or whatever
C :  Yeah
D :  Um you can see here at the else
D :  There's the old one
C :  Oh is more
D :  Well that's that's your is this original
C :  Oh i see
C :  Oh this is the one that okay
D :  Yeah yeah which is call feature that
D :  Um
A :  Probably wanna think about it for a change
A :  Oh calls and stuff
A :  I think it uh um one thing that we could probably skip
A :  Uh it totally is the removing things from the audio files
C :  That's why i thought was well i mean do we uh we are we actually gonna turn that
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Now i don't
A :  That's that's too big
C :  I don't think so either yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  I think that's gonna be we don't even know that approach that uh okay
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  It's a good thing to have to say we care what we could have done that we had more time give you to work things and it's to get the conclusion
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  The final report sure that we have more time is it
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right
A :  I
D :  The three was to discover some sort of time warp thing it's not happen
C :  Um
B :  They have
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah but that's the thing we want thing we could just remove
C :  Um
C :  So maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading but i put it on that changes since the initial specification
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah sure
A :  Yeah
C :  And say
C :  Yeah we didn't
B :  But i think that's fine
C :  We decided to do
C :  Times two
B :  Well we found there um more important things and without and then
C :  So well
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And whereabout
C :  I would prefer to concentrate on the main uh huh
C :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Yeah
C :  And i think we should probably an comment explicitly on the milestones yeah as well and say we manage to do
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah this this and
C :  Mm hm me these small say that
D :  Or some of them were a bit later somewhere yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah so you know they have shows section okay
D :  We could even
A :  I mean we have an really yeah
C :  Like you know develop press tab do we wish to you know ah yeah we manage that
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Exactly
C :  Nicely
B :  Hmmm best file on target or something
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah more or less the same
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah but it's pretty good
B :  I said that
D :  Search yeah
B :  Well i
D :  Plus plus or minus three days okay
A :  It it it doesn't have to know exactly how i
D :  Yeah that's i did this yeah yeah
B :  I
A :  I mean i think my mean that and vegetable i i
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  So it a six day city the topic segmentation it's not use this is i
A :  Yes it is it
C :  "'cause" sections
A :  I
D :  I as well
B :  I
D :  Eleven b. i. s. p. l. p. s. m. s. t. v.
B :  I
C :  Um mm
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh
C :  And you can say yeah
C :  We say we're still aiming for the mm
B :  If you characterisation
B :  Jesus
C :  That meant to be completely much right so so
B :  Be a writer this was we've done already
D :  Oh really
B :  Yeah to you guys have
C :  Oh yeah
B :  I
D :  One is one of those something do you wanna
D :  Change and delete from are
D :  List of expectations
B :  Gimme we cannot say i i
D :  Yeah okay
C :  I yeah i
D :  Like should put it a hint that something like that might happen in to the document
B :  Or maybe the speech i try this in my gets low bal
D :  Okay alright
C :  Yeah
C :  That's right i i really wanna do it i mean it's not
B :  Probably
B :  We white disappear yeah
D :  Yeah i know yeah
C :  It's not the me difficult if it least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata far
D :  Uh-huh
C :  That's gonna be know what cool
D :  Yeah okay yeah true yeah
C :  So it's i think it'd be something there
D :  Okay sounds good
B :  Yeah that make it disappear but we want to do it down a bit
B :  Um but no no yeah but but uh
C :  Yeah in like to know me and
C :  Cool
B :  Uh yeah
C :  Mm
B :  The topic segmentation the the l. c. second textiles and basically down just needs to be
D :  Okay
B :  Down these are in the car yeah it shouldn't be a search of the parameters place main or something
D :  Two and a as a as a yeah
D :  I
C :  I
B :  There's a will have as i
C :  Yeah mm
C :  Yeah sounds good
C :  Yes
A :  Oh sure we changed
C :  We should probably
C :  Sorry we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well
A :  That that counts
C :  That's what he into that we should also it and indicate to use respond for war
C :  From a one
D :  Like but we just copy that's true but the other one as well
B :  You pretty much
D :  It's essentially the same as the ones
D :  More detailed specifically
C :  When you could pull you know
C :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Yeah
A :  Should we i dunno
A :  I would think
A :  Mike but are things that we had can actually
D :  But there's a part yeah i think so yeah well yeah i'm very far
A :  I mean now
A :  Yeah i mean we have now waiting for that then you have the other but what about them
D :  Exactly
A :  "'cause" um disfluencies
D :  No but for skipping the audio one and then set easier
A :  Should we
D :  Um
A :  You just keep it together on the i think the paper
D :  Have you taken any more for a look at it
A :  There right now and just see what what
D :  Be taken any more look at it a bit slides okay yeah
A :  No not the disfluencies
D :  Okay
D :  We could probably
D :  No for time to look at that point or
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah i might be yeah i
D :  We could just make it up
C :  So it and
D :  Like a plane when you claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one is uh a joint one
D :  Maybe
A :  Okay
C :  Have you manage any further on the such thing
D :  Um how you found finally today something that i can build in in in it so i should have something for tomorrow we should it down least
D :  Very least have um
D :  Agree
C :  Alright
D :  And uh where
C :  That's nice
D :  I'll be wearing that in help or morning
D :  So i wanna get something i wanna see that someone interested other have an image in my mind me just wanna see it
A :  I
C :  Yeah yeah yeah
D :  On the thing and then can a screen shot
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah my intent is to
A :  Broken these things tomorrow bit more as well so i don't know
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Please send it in and of new maybe i can add a few sentences i
D :  Well
D :  Well i really matter i mean you can write the sentences first as well
D :  I mean with the intention that this is done i mean and also
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  That is done there is no idea how to avoid lemon or
D :  Some sometimes it a bit of a motivating factor to you i mean you write down the words and ideas of how would you want to do something yeah
A :  But yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Or false together
A :  Let's see
B :  How about the underlying
B :  Data for it
B :  For the devices file
D :  No
B :  As a problem
A :  Well i was still like struggling with
A :  And uh well stuff and then yeah but
D :  Yeah
B :  Mm
A :  More kind
A :  Um i think yeah i was wondering about that is uh
A :  Haven't looked at it so much better if
A :  But many case now
A :  How we could do that like from the the the extract worse that you did like also in it is extract to time stamps and
B :  Easy uh just
A :  Stuff so it can use it
B :  Yeah would just um when he pulls up the segments
A :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  Mm part of that one of the of one of the actual d. c. t. guess that should be in school medical can't actually use that as a mismatch of use
A :  Okay
B :  So it's a dozen and then it is you can
B :  Tell tell you what actually just got
A :  Okay
B :  And then he they automatically or you can just caught on inside know get me the time stamps so you say
B :  Um i guess actually um paul i think is i think them at school "'cause" that should be
A :  Okay
B :  And this is cool start time and time
A :  Okay
B :  And outside and stop consonants ones
A :  Okay
B :  Your sense at all
A :  Okay
A :  Yeah so much just
A :  But in some
B :  Yeah that's on the um then the the normal light elements
A :  Two or something yeah
A :  What on the
B :  Good to be the object is the norm right element of thing
A :  Okay
A :  Mm
B :  Yes mm mm
A :  Okay
A :  Mm hmm
C :  So what is that um did you and you may to another and browse uh is uh something that i should
D :  Um there is at that time
D :  I mean a lot of changes to it so i might just um delete what i've done in copy jane from yours country point made some changes
D :  Already
C :  Moses you do that or
D :  No no so funny yes okay
C :  No
C :  But i will tonight that's the point
D :  Do you said okay our anything
D :  Okay i do use of the year it
D :  But in some things that may be of course and box and then you were can uh
D :  It was and we condition
C :  No
D :  Okay
C :  And we can
D :  Yeah okay
A :  Uh-huh
C :  I think we can zap
D :  Okay cool
C :  Yeah
D :  Mm
C :  Mm hmm
D :  Yes if you all their stuff like that
D :  Okay i'm gonna try to minimise the amount of change the meeting browser yes
D :  Shouldn't time
D :  Should finish it actually just to clarify last we gonna talk about are search results um
D :  Like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as well as in the summaries
D :  Um we want separate result means
D :  Uh for each of those are do we want them all in one pane with like an icon are different colours something to indicate what type
D :  Of result they are so twenty
D :  You click on that it's gonna go to the broad band thing
D :  We just if they
D :  Check all three say topic summary of what what have three different windows come up
C :  Uh-huh yeah yeah
D :  Or three it like some some been sort of
C :  Well at the moment is that
C :  At the moment is there we know that comes up or is that it a second result pain was a row you know some there'd be larger was uh
D :  Um
D :  What
D :  Um
D :  I thought we we sort of discussed last week as targets are on the same window um so will be on the street when the bottom have to search window
C :  Are you thinking
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Um
D :  And we still wanna keep it that way but that's uh that's what is gonna be working with that that's just like you click "'cause" that's just looked at
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah but that thing into like two or three or whatever it is
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  One two three depending on which ones you check
C :  Um
D :  And then um
D :  So if we wanna do it that way
D :  Yeah but it probably doesn't matter too much
D :  Just write think it is gonna be any other
C :  Yeah
D :  Issues down the road um depending on
B :  Well i have
B :  You confuse me to have um
B :  Three seven when those are the three separate different out a result
D :  No just just pains just result pains which are the three
B :  Okay not not three different okay okay cool
D :  No no no no
D :  No i don't know so is this is one week like to know topics and summaries for what we wanna search channel that you have to be to result beans
A :  I had a
B :  Right yeah
A :  So uh
D :  So for one for topics one for i dunno the cats um
B :  Alt tab tools like
C :  Oh i like the idea of time in that case
D :  But then you can see uh all of them at the same time i was just like
A :  All those and no
C :  But you want want to compare that was all the top one topic was all with one summer use uh what it
D :  Well it's no but the thing is if you're looking if you take them both um you wanna see all the results
C :  Actually in yeah especially if you get
B :  Yeah yeah so it is
C :  If you get results for the same meeting
D :  Yeah exactly yeah so the summary in the topic and then transcript yeah
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  That's true
D :  So um
D :  Or we could just put them all into one result pain
C :  You know
D :  On that same and uh and just indicate
C :  I mean we could we could order them but meeting at some point
D :  Oh yeah i guess i was other thing whether we wanna have this
C :  How to alright
D :  We order by columns on that but that's i have to
C :  Yeah well i mean if
C :  You know that's it you in the second step the first question is do we want to order them how do we want wood and then first place
D :  It's a lot of work
D :  Channel
D :  Yeah
D :  I think yeah probably buying meeting makes more sense i mean essentially their time you know in time order so
C :  Yeah
D :  That kinda makes more sense
C :  Yeah maybe we should do that
D :  Least yeah
D :  Yeah
D :  Should be nice and no one and two
D :  Should be from these i guess
C :  Yeah
C :  What i mean you just um
C :  Colour code those
D :  Yeah
C :  The results to
D :  Thinking sometimes in the case like that like to run across um
C :  So you didn't close
D :  In in other languages just that
D :  It's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally wanted to put into like a list box or something
D :  Try to tell whether was a a transcript or whatever and then up or highlighting something in the transcript window
D :  It may be difficult to get that information back
D :  Once it's
D :  Just in
D :  All those parks an an enormous power
D :  That's us
C :  Maybe if you
D :  Or is it is coming from
C :  If you if you do it
C :  Straight from you know you get you get the result and then there's a sort of statement saying is straight on the you know brought palm a level saying if it if you found a segment then
D :  Yeah
C :  Colour right
C :  Print it in red oh well um
D :  Great
D :  Yeah
D :  So
C :  As opposed to
D :  Um yeah it's just like from
D :  That's expensive
D :  There's a few little things that happen in just doesn't but you save
C :  Uh
D :  Certain things in this is kind of
C :  Uh well
D :  Um trying to to do a different kind of to go to different window so if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript and i like the top or something
C :  Have a lot
C :  Oh uh_huh
D :  At that point that's what we're stuck in a little bit tricky "'cause" you're
C :  Yeah yeah i can imagine
D :  Working with an event handle are within the one
D :  I know where it was box whatever it is
D :  And um
C :  Or see yeah
D :  Um there are ways around it but you know whether okay we'll figure something out like that till forty or oh yeah no
C :  You you have to use actions
D :  Or delegates or whatever
D :  And so so
C :  Um
D :  Yes
C :  Yeah i mean um adam and it works
C :  A waste of highlighting in in the transcript when they're doesn't it
C :  So
D :  I think you saying that as long as we implement that um
D :  Interface
D :  Um it should work with anything do we do like highlighting yeah
D :  I think there was some
D :  We saying that
C :  We need to work with them
D :  Um isn't jonathan think something like that because just like one is we implement one of these interfaces for at this particular type when do we should be able to have that highlighting
D :  Happen
C :  Uh-huh
D :  And um
D :  Yes
C :  Yeah i mean the whole um
C :  Yeah and what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special form of paying
C :  Made by night so i i'm not sure what it's called know um
D :  Okay
C :  Uh so mm
C :  Mm
C :  No i don't know what it's called
C :  And that comes with the whole load of
C :  Highlighting
C :  Extras as well as i said you know if you if you have taken something for example highlights automatically
D :  Okay okay alright
D :  Okay
C :  So maybe comes with something clever as well
D :  Okay maybe we should
D :  Maybe we should use that as well um mm
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
B :  Scroll and not to explain or something
C :  No it's not been in it
C :  No yeah
C :  I dunno a tech
B :  Text area also
C :  Thanks yeah also not might yep
B :  Something uh
C :  Norman text areas uh i i
B :  On the same i see things called normal yeah
C :  Yeah i all i what's the norm anyway
D :  Yeah why
B :  No i don't take model
C :  My
D :  Okay i make sense
B :  Okay yeah yeah
A :  But is it
C :  Huh
B :  Night on takes model i think that's what they did i
C :  Yeah
A :  Mm "'kay"
C :  Mm
D :  Hmm
A :  Hmm
B :  But they um
B :  They
B :  Removing the disfluencies you done a thing with that yeah
B :  Anybody
A :  Mm
B :  "'cause" um
B :  I was wondering how we're gonna
B :  Right it back to h. t. m. l. i mean extra well if we take if we did the price is saying
D :  Um
B :  Right to be a bad thing so well
D :  I thought we were just going to have uh those words like that is not as x. m. l. just sort of as a
B :  Is it broke of text
D :  Well the side um
B :  That's well
D :  Well transcript be so on and trendy know "'cause" then we need all the other day that we wanna keep the transcript
B :  You very much in a between do it is nine x. m. l. format as well
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah see
D :  Yeah that's true yeah
B :  There is some there's a method that put things back into x. m. l. format
C :  Why you why do we wanna in x. m. l. that i mean i thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively right there is another we've got
B :  Wow
C :  So as as opposed to
A :  Yeah
B :  Are you select what we want just like that so there's not a any text and segments
C :  Yeah it
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah any any print out certain um certain segments of things that we want to select of each at the moment you press that one of them or just one if we're gonna
A :  Yeah i like it
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  That he's out some of the prince evans
B :  Ten seconds okay yeah yeah alright
A :  Yeah
C :  Not not store it's walls and uh
B :  Okay
D :  Oh yeah okay then that's a that's not yeah
A :  Yeah that's right that's what i think we like
C :  Because
B :  It says something different uh that's all
D :  Yeah i know
A :  Okay
D :  That's true we're thinking of four
C :  Oh alright
B :  And then to learn to find accommodations and with the the done that that would mean that you can only these things on fashion i like him to become one level
D :  Actually but this makes more sense
D :  Yeah
B :  So yeah that's fine
D :  Yeah if we're gonna do the action along fine that's
B :  Yeah
A :  We we're not really well i mean
D :  The problem is an easy
A :  We have to me too much more than just look at the
A :  The room like on that experiment disfluencies "'cause" we're gonna search it and we're not gonna
A :  Like listen to it
C :  Yeah
A :  Since we're not doing the audio thing
B :  Yeah
A :  So
C :  So well
A :  I guess just displaying it is
B :  This one
A :  Alright but well i'll yep
D :  As tax i mean
C :  Yeah yeah you don't mean you need to do much more with uh yeah that's right
A :  No
B :  Yeah they will
D :  I think it's like well how would we displayed a like a big you take this functions and just could you could a text file think they just want to a text on them
B :  It would just be a bloodbath this summer a while like once a speaker access the speaker why says that's because that's as uh this and
D :  Yeah
A :  Uh-huh
D :  "'cause" we extract out of the file when we create a text file
B :  Yeah that would have only probably "'cause" it a little display for one
D :  Yeah
D :  As cheating
B :  And if you wanna start firing
A :  It's probably best into
A :  It seems that like just like
C :  I don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway it's just another
A :  No
B :  No no but i think that's the thing is true
A :  No
D :  Yeah
C :  Um
C :  I mean these meetings a lot and as you know it's just words and to print one of them out selectively
B :  Does on the fly and uh
C :  Yeah
B :  So they discuss it says it this way because that can print
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  Um
B :  It's the button this time is
C :  You can yeah you do it together with
C :  With the t. transcription with the racial transcription have more um power all
C :  So if certain you know if it's a proper way it's
C :  Print on base
C :  It pains if it's no problem with them printed you want
C :  I mean that's that's you know fancy pet
B :  Yeah you could be conditions were in as we know that would've can just in fact make a rabbit
C :  The um
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Would be the same thing
C :  But then
C :  You know the the the good way of doing it um
C :  Not together is that be
C :  If someone doesn't wanna look at the the mm mm
C :  You know the chopped well then you don't have a half to produce it
B :  In a cat
C :  Mm hmm so
C :  But i mean you can you know you can ride we can
C :  Right something like a um well trying to an on the fly in
C :  And uh the if it's not gonna is gonna take to know if it's gonna take a while think about
C :  Writing it to
C :  A file
B :  Should know it's just the the just be used items when they were foster parents um
C :  And in off line
C :  Yeah and
D :  Or uh-huh
D :  I just think as well i mean we could probably then use like x. s. l. t. yeah
B :  There's loads of a style
D :  Can i just transform it
D :  You put it into yeah
B :  Was that
D :  Yeah just um transforms on like um
D :  Style sheet time to know
C :  Alright
D :  L. c. and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built and it yeah well i mean
D :  To process
D :  Excellent
D :  I can just just quits whatever file it's gonna be in
D :  Yeah and company simply looking thing like this but uh
D :  I mean in been easy way
D :  And then that way we could even preprocessing uh
D :  Four yeah i dunno two more we don't have to do that right
B :  No i wouldn't wanna have to put it take put it back into it's about over the entire e. d. n. x. so i would always a couple good enough
D :  Although on the fly it's to pick it
D :  Is typically pretty fine
D :  And
B :  Okay but uh in a completely
D :  Oh really okay
B :  It is a feedback to
D :  Yeah
B :  And not stuff "'cause" you know what's what's easy
C :  Yeah
D :  Hmm
B :  To wind it would not stuff there in the last one thing i was it can be
D :  Yeah okay yeah
B :  Tell which are these uh i was just so i'll complicated was will take it
D :  Okay
A :  Hmm
D :  Yeah
B :  Believe it
B :  You have to start defining all jet model slightly not thing and getting
D :  Yeah okay
D :  You serious
B :  Overall
D :  It's insane
B :  With things um mm
D :  I just think i might try and talked to was a jonathan thing which is to see what they what system they used it all this stuff could be nice to have all the tools there and just like have topic model and just kinda like plug and play with everything in just actually use a system
C :  Hmm
D :  You have a higher level rather than kinda you're playing around a little bit code modifying your code in this and uh
D :  It is useful to see what you're doing so
D :  I might tell
D :  Can conjure considers
D :  Uh
D :  Any other
D :  And so if you give us
D :  Just to get things
D :  I dunno moving in a higher level i guess
D :  Seems to be more
D :  Interesting
D :  To use it as a a real developer would
D :  It seems like a little tinkering here and and sending couple things
C :  That's what program is all about on friday
D :  No no no it shouldn't be know that should be higher level it should be
D :  Conceptual um you know coming up with a brilliant ideas and then just
D :  Yeah bring those two realities
C :  Yeah
B :  I
C :  Maybe that's the higher people
D :  Yeah
B :  I
C :  Yeah
A :  The frame bit too
C :  Well i mean
C :  Yeah why don't you pull buy for both of those ideas in into that
C :  That paragraph and say
C :  You have a look at this is something
C :  If you were do that
C :  I i personally don't wanna mess with uh
D :  Yeah
C :  Writing files or anything at the moment the one that it's it actually
C :  Mm hmm
D :  But the thing there is you know there's also want it stand for
D :  Yeah one meeting it's time and it's there is no text file or x. m. l. or whatever it is but
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah just
D :  I don't know does it doesn't make any difference really either way to me
D :  Like hmm
D :  If it's fast have on the fly then sure
D :  Um that's what the only sure how put on the fly
D :  Well it's fast
C :  Yeah
B :  But you were we
D :  Especially with job and something happens if it's loading the file
D :  And and yes
D :  Processing
C :  We have already do i did anyway
B :  Yeah so it's softer side of it
B :  It's just it's just a falling ready to be fine
D :  Whether runs on a memory
B :  Yeah
C :  So shall we alright um a lecture to a future work as well
B :  Yeah i see the future work in mind section button
C :  I would actually
D :  Yeah
C :  Oh right
B :  I just said uh said well done so far along gonna be
C :  Yeah well maybe you could
B :  And some for some issues and then it's
D :  Actually yeah that makes sense
C :  Maybe you could split up and
D :  Um of like into each
B :  I think you'll a stick
C :  Yeah like yeah is what we've done already and then you know down here
D :  Yeah
B :  Might lose a bit of cutting its e. v. d. uh as was thinking that sometimes is easy to have the topic in its own instructions user interface about three charges easy we can uh
D :  Yeah
C :  Mm
D :  I think that does make sense but maybe at the end maybe just a a point form of you know things that
D :  We're still working on things all day yeah yeah
C :  Maybe
B :  Calls or something something like that but it will points
C :  Yeah that's right yeah yeah maybe
B :  Yeah because you have a discuss this thing and then uh we'll discuss it thing uh
D :  Yeah i know watching
B :  Then all together you lose a lot of that um continuous yeah
C :  Mm yeah maybe right
C :  Mm
C :  Sounds good
B :  So apart from the
C :  Anything else
C :  Do we want to do about
C :  Well see money
C :  A a a
A :  Yeah
C :  Then to know
A :  Well
A :  I
