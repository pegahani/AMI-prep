A :  Um
A :  Yeah
A :  I
B :  Radio
A :  Okay thank you
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Sorry
B :  Oh yeah uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Where do we have two different microphones
D :  Mm
A :  Well with the
A :  You know the different thing
B :  Interesting
A :  "'kay" can't see my own screen
A :  Alright
A :  Okay here it care
A :  Right the agenda for of it all
D :  Mm
A :  Alright um the agenda for this meeting
A :  Is um will
A :  Initially have the prototype presentation
D :  Mm
A :  There are two designers
D :  Mm
A :  Then we'll evaluate it
A :  Given the criteria that um that we d.
A :  David and um talk about
A :  I find it says whether we were
A :  And euro for our budget
A :  I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate
A :  Um our prices for every
A :  Aspect of of what we need
A :  Given our options and town evaluate the product
A :  As a group
B :  Okay
A :  And um
A :  So for so have the prototype presentation do you need the um powerpoint for this
B :  Um yeah i just got a few slide
B :  It's a sort of
B :  Thank you
B :  Can't have uh
B :  Okay
C :  Um
B :  Yeah here we are
C :  This is that we cannot with
C :  I pretty simple design that um
C :  Based on uh
C :  Mango week yeah
D :  Okay
B :  Mango to
A :  Uh-huh mango okay
C :  Yeah i we have their company look or here
C :  And this will be there
C :  And for ads
B :  I i think be
C :  And this would be the powerpoint that
C :  On off but
A :  Oh okay
C :  Yeah
D :  So what was it was a lady
C :  It's in the battle for the little r.
D :  Okay
C :  Power on this the power
C :  And uh
C :  We just have a sample design we want is all to be
B :  It's palm how
C :  That's the pool from your cell yep am house and
C :  Although
C :  Buttons are accessible from some
A :  That's another number ten by mm
C :  Oh that was a mistake "'cause" that
C :  Right now
B :  It just it to go up
A :  I
D :  Hmm
D :  I
C :  That one
D :  Uh huh
C :  Sorry i was in charge of the north
D :  Uh-huh
A :  I
A :  Oh work
A :  Uh
C :  And this is just so you've got like eleven or twelve or
C :  Three reports
B :  So one plus one eleven or
C :  If you go one to three years and then
A :  Oh you press a plus but
C :  To press our first and then you go one three yeah
A :  Oh okay i've never heard of that kind of four
C :  All which has star
C :  We have all the numbers here so we wanted something and
C :  Representative of numbers or shouldn't and and
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Because if you on me on average um
B :  And then if you pressed ones y. c. d. is going to um all the same you want to channel twelve you press one
B :  I need a channel one and then to to need just go to channel two instead of twelve
D :  Oh there's no uh uh okay
B :  So if you did like one plus two
A :  Oh
C :  Yeah
B :  If it goes to what's well what's two plus two is channel to me
D :  Okay
A :  Which you have to zero plus one if you want to go to channel one or two
C :  No no and all that so we have all these numbers these numbers some
C :  These numbers all work
C :  And apparently opting nine
A :  Yeah but i mean
A :  If you press it'll go to that channel right away
C :  Yeah
A :  "'cause" that press the plastic after it's
C :  Oh no the plus on it for a second pass the number nine
A :  Yeah i know but if if i wanna go to say number
D :  Six
A :  Like sixty five to channel sixty five to press the six
A :  It'll go to channel six and now press the plus and then all those six and then put the five another sixty five
C :  No you press the plus first i i i i will
B :  No
C :  We have a nice
C :  I would've thought you press spokesperson and six five but she's this was i
B :  Well i i do i do get a fair to define that
C :  What what do you reckon
A :  I've
C :  Well or
A :  Um
B :  I i would've thought to be a problem they want to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah wouldn't be a problem that i was just wondering like
C :  Yeah
B :  Right so is is no i was
D :  Well that
A :  As long as we realise that's what we'll do
D :  Does that
D :  There's a delay on remotes i think where you can have a
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  It's like a five second and third time so as long as it happened to that
B :  Yeah if you don't put it
B :  Yeah yeah that
C :  Yeah
D :  It should be fine
A :  Yeah
D :  Those are deposited into balance
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  Um
D :  Was it is and on the top there is volume and
B :  And channel
C :  Channel
B :  Which is so
D :  Channel up a limo okay cool
B :  You could just go like that without thinking about that
A :  See in v.
C :  Just so we can
A :  Right where um where's the power button
C :  It's in the middle of a know
B :  The big are
C :  Hours
A :  Oh okay
B :  So it's a six
C :  Yeah so
C :  It's a like a fast ball was like in taking your hand off the remote
B :  Which site
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh we went for like uh
B :  Uh sake in there
B :  Design the for the know that because it was kind of a more natural movement and just going like that with your thumb
A :  Oh okay
B :  The economic zero consider
A :  Economic that
B :  Yeah
C :  It might actually up with uh repetitive stress injury
B :  It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury that but yeah i know i mean it's a different
C :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Movement so
C :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  The feel of it i mean we've made this out of plato which is representing the united about that
A :  The spongy yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  The spongy we have a nice
B :  Um
B :  Because it was
B :  Said before in the material specification that this the this anti r. s. i. d.
B :  Um materials often used and stress balls so this is got a you know a bit of give to it and it's just
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah but the stress ball field
B :  Feels real difference like theory is that how it fits in the palm of your hand
C :  Yeah
A :  Yes i will right
A :  My goodness
C :  I
B :  I
A :  Yeah you could
B :  Right
B :  But it it
D :  Yes
A :  The ratio
C :  I
D :  Oh it's nice all i think a couple five
B :  Yeah
D :  I did like uh the four oh god
A :  And something
A :  I
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay at so the cat is they will send it with them a limited range
D :  That's often
B :  Well colours for this prototype
C :  Play-doh so yeah
B :  Are we thinking that
B :  C. is are having in interchangeable casing anyway
B :  That
B :  This is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that
B :  We would necessarily use all the combination
B :  Um i was thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme the coloured
B :  Um
B :  Combinations just to be named after
B :  Different fruit like
A :  Um right
B :  But now i'm a group like it i would rather than grew you know of in a low might be the most popular fetus there
B :  Plans in
C :  Subtle and
B :  More settled cream instead of the others or a bit
A :  Yeah looks more
B :  Garish
A :  Do like the middle and banana would
B :  But at is more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black
C :  Yeah
A :  Oh okay yeah
B :  So that for corporate and see that would probably be there is very good i mean what's well and yeah there will probably appealing to the
A :  Yeah
A :  Kinda christmas you know
B :  Yeah seasonal
C :  Yeah
B :  Apple green brown more kind of trendy and a card key
A :  Yeah
C :  The pomegranate a big guarantee and
C :  Phone keychain the end
A :  Cool
C :  And now it's more for the
C :  More sophisticated i just don't
B :  Yeah
A :  I
C :  So that for some us all
C :  Dick or
B :  Okay
B :  Um yeah with all the components that steph me um
B :  The focus of economics and to just
B :  A single how hand-held device um you don't need to use both hands one hand the whole this
B :  And type immediately can just use your thumb
C :  Yeah
B :  Um
B :  As is that the rubber as we we used to come to an anti r. s. i.
B :  And that's about it
A :  Alright thank you very much
A :  Could work every why
D :  Have um
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Alright
A :  And so now that we've
A :  We have a prototype
A :  Are we need to go over the finances and seeing if this
A :  Prototype match is that what our budget can handle
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So i have
A :  Something going to
D :  You want the
A :  Oh energy need to do a presentation first
D :  I dunno what ordered goes and i have one
A :  Yeah i'm gonna check that out for sake yeah
B :  Thank you
B :  No i need that
A :  But it was it
A :  Oh yeah sorry right evaluation criteria six mine
D :  Another issue
D :  That's me
D :  Hello
D :  O. g. e.
D :  Come on my computer
D :  Sorry my computer screen we technical difficulties
A :  Discussed um function it again
D :  So i press it again
D :  A side of the touch
D :  Okay you're right
A :  And then again i think
A :  One more time
D :  Oh still not there
D :  Okay now i think for this one i could just for use the whiteboard um it may be adjusted on right on the screen we can see it i'm gonna be doing in evaluation report together based on the product tape that we've just seen
D :  Um and looking looking back to my notes from our but our conceptual on our functional meetings
D :  Um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were um back to our kick-off meeting this morning
D :  Um and we'll evaluate as to whether we've spent what we said to do
D :  Um and we're gonna do it on a uh one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false
D :  So basically the warp or lower the points the better
D :  Uh-huh okay so question number one
D :  Does the remote website
D :  Or not we are a lot of on the whiteboard i can't change it it's um and as you push down wants
A :  Okay
D :  Alright underscores up on that
D :  Okay so number one do we have a fancy look-and-feel
C :  Mm
B :  See oh i think
B :  We've been quite successful with a rubber uh kind of thing um
A :  Yeah
A :  The look is a little bit more playful
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah is it has a definition of fancy stuff like different
D :  It's not a traditional
A :  Oh definitely afraid yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  I think the cat has a lot to do with it i mean all
D :  Uh-huh
B :  The colours we were given for uh
B :  Making a prototype um the colours that
B :  I think we wouldn't necessarily cherries and it's not the kind of
C :  Yeah
B :  But uh it's all see
A :  We're only given red and black
B :  Red black and yellow and orange
C :  He assume
A :  Oh okay
B :  Yeah yeah
B :  Um
C :  We can we don't wanna go for part because
C :  Most remote controls or black or grey so we want it to be
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Standard that way anyway
B :  They if you can imagine that in like i was just it may be room
A :  Oh okay
B :  Uh a kind of pay all
B :  Mm that's how like you finished or something
C :  Yeah and that's hockey fan a sure thing
B :  Well i don't know is for rubber uh i mean if
A :  Yeah
C :  Oh yes
C :  Okay
B :  You can visualise this in
B :  Nice colours i think you would that way
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  I can i like the potato okay
D :  It's very
A :  It's a mango
B :  Oh well say oh my god for a bad
D :  As well
A :  Mango i
D :  I was i the mango mango here
B :  I
C :  I
B :  I think that's right phases one
D :  Okay yeah yeah if they're actual depends on your mood
C :  I
B :  Yeah so really it's really it out all
D :  So i myself would say a one or two
A :  I would say two
C :  I mean i'd to to thing
D :  Okay and
B :  For that
C :  Fanciness
D :  One being true
D :  So
B :  I yeah it's you
D :  Two okay
C :  Yeah
B :  For that
D :  Actually that's pro as we get confusing
D :  Okay so question number two uh it's
D :  Is it tech and technologically innovative so uh i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah and the use the rubber
D :  These are the rubber the use of d.
C :  Yeah
B :  For the anti r. s. i.
A :  Yeah
D :  L. e. d.
B :  Uh i leds isn't
B :  Particularly innovative
C :  Mm
B :  And so we don't have any scroll buttons it's all pushbuttons is no l. c. d. controls so if we thinking about the rest of the market
A :  Yeah
B :  It's all for we halfway in some
B :  Aspect is
A :  Yeah that's a relief to re
B :  Like you said
C :  I'll go for three it's uh
D :  Yeah
D :  And i think i mean it it's have to say because we will we don't want to be more innovative and that's because then i would've
B :  Yeah there's a specification
A :  Yeah we want it simple
D :  Defeated the purpose so
C :  Samples uh
D :  I mean i will put three but i think we actually reached are cool
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  We don't want it anymore and uh
D :  Okay "'cause" number three uh it will be easy to use
A :  I think so
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah fairy i think one
D :  Yeah so
D :  Yeah i think it's
A :  Yeah one
B :  Yeah
D :  Can we get confused or that
C :  No
D :  I mean they'll be used to wear to work out the a number
A :  The plus number thing
D :  The plus system but once that's figured out
C :  Yeah but
C :  This thing yeah
B :  Yeah i'm perhaps that any on
D :  It should be fine
D :  Number four is a good looking remote remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
B :  Mm
B :  Again i think the colour comes into this
C :  It's sad
A :  Yeah colour would that would be a factor
D :  Uh-huh
A :  I think that that logo could be smaller
B :  Okay
C :  Yeah
A :  And maybe not a problem in
A :  Way
C :  But that
A :  You look at the bottom
A :  Kind of
C :  Remember the management said that uh it had to be a problem
B :  No i'm
D :  Whoops
A :  Well just had to be on there i guess
D :  It's just not touch it
C :  Yeah
B :  I
D :  I said was the three i killed
B :  I
D :  I was is what if it should be like flat or
D :  Or or
B :  As far as i recall quite big huh
A :  I like the appeal of it being like up
A :  Pick a lot to do here
C :  Yeah
B :  Okay
C :  But you know what i've just thought as that night what where's the case that kind of that
C :  All of that are out of this whole
A :  Maybe if the bottom as a sort of flat
D :  Yeah the bottom could be like
A :  I mean the rest is like
C :  Yeah
D :  Top of it
C :  But i i wouldn't say that's called lane you uh
A :  Round
D :  Um that's true
A :  It's topic of people
B :  Things like that i it's not going in it i think you mean
D :  Maybe it can
A :  You can handle uh the the
D :  It could be on the bottom so you wouldn't do like if it's flat here so it's it's up
D :  Like that
C :  All that would be nice
A :  Off all over all the time of you know
B :  Yeah it's less
C :  Yeah
B :  Um what
D :  It has waited maybe
C :  I
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Sky-high a senator gramm icsi like that
D :  Details details
A :  Okay well i i
D :  Yeah it's know if that's a good looking remote
D :  Would you wanna show not sure friends hmm
C :  Really
C :  You but no "'cause" that it's address and then also the
D :  Yeah
A :  I think
A :  There's another colour and it was like
A :  Look okay maybe two
D :  And i i get yes personal taste but
B :  I would definitely go sour of them might get average plano
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Remote like that that death mean another kind i'm not happy with that is correct
D :  Okay so should say two
A :  Sure
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Uh at question number five what's
D :  Um well people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control look fancy
C :  I think we have to market it in the right way that um just say that it was simplistic so people can just see it and then
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
C :  This is so simplistic i do want to spend twenty five euros we have to market
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah and the marketing well let's do it then
B :  Yeah
B :  And
C :  And the kinetic energy part yeah
B :  Three
B :  Kinetic energy take a style we we do do
A :  Yeah
D :  I shake it or not but it's well i i
B :  I
A :  They're a ball
C :  Which
B :  They they're mm
D :  Uh
B :  There's all be fair be on
C :  I don't know what the plot
D :  No i guess i don't know much about the remote control industry how much an average
D :  Cells for
A :  Sure marketing expert
D :  I know i am i nine
C :  I tried to handle
C :  Ten point
C :  Right okay
C :  Like ten
D :  But you have to buy batteries so when the long term this connection city many so market it that way to
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah that's true
A :  Oh oh
A :  Exactly
B :  Yeah
D :  So yeah i think with the good marketing scheme
B :  Good point
D :  Um and the personalisation options so
A :  Yeah i'd give it a two still
B :  Yeah yeah
D :  Okay numbers sex concern read it out
B :  Does the sports that much the operating behaviour of the i mean she is that
C :  Yeah
D :  Um yeah so that was me with that
B :  Yeah
C :  I think at all
A :  Oh yeah
D :  The statistics it said
C :  Very well
B :  Because
B :  Yeah because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel changing and it's just
D :  Uh-huh
B :  You won't have to think about that you don't have to look down to find them
B :  Clearly that easy to use
D :  Yeah i guess the any the keyword there is average "'cause" there were some people they use the uh video input and sound and stuff but then that's
B :  Simple
B :  Yeah
B :  Mm
D :  You and i really so
D :  Okay so one
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Number seven could have that you push it down
D :  Well that's remote control be easy to find when lost remember the future some users lose their remote regularly there's the idea
A :  We have the alarm system
D :  Is a line systems tall was it implemented
C :  Yeah but but uh when you
C :  Yeah so wants to the light
B :  Yeah the lights on and off last job i mean
C :  I
C :  I don't think that
B :  It's
B :  Obviously obvious from outside the lots and uh
C :  And your pinkie on the market and
B :  "'cause" you can't
B :  Take me see you know um
A :  I thought the light on the inside some like that
C :  Yeah the light it will
A :  Or was it like a know it is
B :  Yeah but when a lounge not yeah if you
D :  I
C :  Well
A :  But but make so no it's right
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  It turns into a doctor's cracking
B :  Yeah that
D :  Yeah yeah
A :  Ah so
C :  Okay
B :  Well think it if it was have a lounge system
D :  Um
B :  I mean when it when it lights up as a i mean you could light up when the alarm mine
C :  Yeah
B :  If it was hidden
B :  And me to cushion or something won't be any point
B :  So you can't
B :  C. d. rom but it would like to
C :  And we have to be in the more
A :  I thought was originally use
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah i'll i'll be can't see it and i'll on inside because the alarm system itself
C :  Yeah but you still could
C :  We just go
C :  The back or something
A :  Oh okay
D :  Well use the same lights are on the prototype but yeah l. be there are so we can we can say that
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Oh okay
B :  Yeah sorry
D :  Would you give it a one because compared to be uh the remote ever and ever made this one will be easier fine
B :  Yeah
D :  Um
B :  Sorry have a
A :  No problem
B :  Wasn't very clear
D :  Question um great
D :  Well it be easy to learn how to use this remote when when you remember that thirty four percent of users usually find it difficult so
A :  Totally
D :  It has to be yeah see the pick it up and uh know what to do
C :  So the plot the plus
D :  The plus thing is to work done
C :  What what's up button down on the page that would be really simple
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah i think
B :  Just because it's
B :  We've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons i think that in itself makes it
D :  What
B :  So much easier to use
D :  Doesn't make more sense for the middle what's been just an enter button
D :  So then you would have to press two buttons every time at least
A :  Yeah so it's is like
A :  Channel six
C :  That can have
A :  Six
C :  Annoys me know when it's zero six and you have to press that are we
A :  And there
B :  Mm
A :  Yeah we don't have to press euro
D :  You just press six enter
C :  Oh okay
B :  And all of sixty six and uh
D :  Or want to enter
A :  And then like twelve enter
C :  Alright that
B :  Yeah i think that's probably mostly for it
B :  Good point
D :  Um
D :  Okay so we can that was so yes it's a one
C :  Yeah point
A :  Yeah
D :  Okay
B :  So mm
D :  Question number nine uh well minimise the effects of r. s. i. which was repeated strain injury
C :  Yeah
B :  Injury
D :  Um which affected a over a quarter of users
C :  Mm
A :  It's also great and uh
C :  But if you're stop
A :  Your thumb might get a little bit uh
B :  Yeah that's a thinking
C :  Yeah i still like a wall
B :  We may have to do some research in the uh the strain injury so we don't know about
C :  Yeah
C :  Biology
A :  But it's soft
B :  Uh-huh
D :  And soft and
A :  And that's kind of why the uh
A :  Um
D :  And people could
A :  The powerpoint
A :  Slide things said would be good for
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  R. s. i. "'s" so
D :  I dunno what other options there are
A :  Maybe it is but
B :  I think we can
A :  Yeah
B :  That's true
D :  "'kay" a meeting on your left hand and
D :  Use your index finger
D :  But is not really any other options of sick support so
C :  Yeah
D :  I mean we did as as much stick our remote control
D :  So
D :  One or two do you think
B :  I think
C :  I'd say two
B :  Yeah it's a two
D :  Two okay
D :  Okay number time do we somehow incorporate the company colour logo
A :  Yes
D :  No it's the colour gonna be there even if it's a good in l. uh is the yellow
C :  And we we can't really do that because for example
C :  On the banana theme we can talk for this being yellow
D :  Uh-huh
C :  We'll stand right
C :  So and
C :  It's not always gonna be the same colour
D :  It's either the colours something that we
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah the colours are yellow and grey
C :  Grey yeah
A :  So it could be grey on the banana one
C :  Yeah could be grey
A :  Yeah
D :  I mean the l. e. at the yellow is ugly though depending on the
C :  Yeah that's right we don't need
D :  So if you want to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the r. r.
B :  Mm
B :  Yeah i think this is the
C :  Yeah
B :  The fact that that we've
B :  Be nice success
B :  And
D :  Okay
C :  Perhaps that's how it
B :  Confronting
A :  Yeah
C :  Like that's great and it would be that expensive to have a little bit of that
C :  That was rubber
D :  And the balance in the middle
B :  Okay
D :  So will you think that's more of a three then three four
B :  Four okay
B :  Well i don't
D :  Well we have good reasons for it so we we can still put the
D :  Four
B :  Okay
D :  Okay and final question
D :  Um do we think should or model and put the fashion into electronics
D :  Current trends the fruits and veggies desire for sponginess
A :  I would say so
C :  Well not brief it be to
A :  But maybe
A :  More like two weeks is no like pictures of fruit it's a sort of meaning it by fruit
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah right and the colour scheme names
D :  Yeah
A :  With uh with the colours
C :  Yeah
D :  No it it it plates interchangeable i think i missed
