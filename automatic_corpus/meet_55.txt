C :  Oh other issues other issues
D :  Hmm
A :  Just let a lie down once then
C :  And main problem that we have one for sleep being the finance
D :  Oh
C :  Yeah this is entering the um evaluation criteria
C :  Um
C :  On for some way
C :  The you know we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons
C :  And it's gonna cost is for doing point six euros
D :  Oh
B :  Uh-huh
B :  Uh-huh
C :  So we have to really
A :  What's on the uh on the left
C :  Sorry of action and highlighted somewhere
C :  Um
C :  Oh colour was it and uh
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  So basically
C :  Um in order to say even are two euros
C :  Um i was thinking
C :  That we could have a sense of the same shape but just have a flat and
D :  Hmm
D :  More like a traditional remote control
C :  Um
C :  Yeah i mean it's already got kind of cool shape
D :  Uh-huh
C :  To buy wouldn't have to be curved
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And enact
C :  And by doing so on on on doesn't save as quite as much
B :  Uh-huh
C :  I don't know what to do with this again
A :  What why is the uh double curved two of them
C :  Oh good point
B :  And
C :  Um
B :  Double curve on both sides
B :  Or or yeah this is double curved yeah
C :  Curve
B :  This is double curve in this one is single curve
C :  And then i
A :  Mm
B :  As as a single curved is it on both sides

C :  No i think it means double curved as in um
D :  Like an ashtray
C :  Like uh huh
C :  Just got a single curve on that
C :  Well uh huh
C :  And the double curved
C :  Would be if it was that someone curve out which okay i'm at the wrong
D :  Okay
B :  Like this one for one decide on that and that's it
C :  I don't like that counts as a curve over that's just a shape
B :  Oh
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
C :  The curvature rest like the
B :  Maybe
C :  Is case
D :  Okay
A :  "'cause" that's the uh the biggest expense yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah and what why have gonna to know a constant to select any more rubber
A :  We had to um
A :  Okay
A :  Well we can work around that
C :  Mm
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Right uh-huh
A :  Things that
B :  Oh uh_huh
A :  Do you think should be one
C :  It's meant to be one yeah i dunno wanted to in there but um
C :  Hold on to uh find a shift button maybe start again
C :  Yeah
C :  That should buttons okay
C :  Um okay so that we take away three u. which would give us
B :  Uh should be
C :  Well that's fine
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Eleven or other euros sixty
D :  Cool
D :  Cool
C :  Um mm mm mm mm mm mm
D :  So we came out so
C :  Wait to know not quite have the scroll wheel and functionally one
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Find the accountants
A :  Five accountants
C :  This
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Mm mm mm
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Uh yeah we could add things

B :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
A :  When you see arrow keys is that we're
C :  Yeah no it just extends as well
A :  No
B :  Uh you can do one thing that and then you just select one box also yeah this will then move it would be good for these okay
C :  I don't know
B :  Yep
C :  That's one of the buttons a stick and i don't know what it's
B :  Uh just just to um mm kay just an
B :  Okay no like this

B :  Yeah it's okay
B :  Should we ask maybe it should we ask about taking
A :  Is it the other shift button maybe
B :  Is workmen's so

C :  Yeah
C :  That's all
C :  Yes or
A :  I stayed yeah
C :  We're on the road
C :  Um "'kay"
C :  Right so let's find answers so i don't know where what do you reckon we could add
C :  Um
B :  Oh
D :  Well maybe but
D :  We could uh something but maybe if
D :  Wait
C :  I suppose those are that's that's our design that we've got
D :  We're trying to save money so mm yeah
C :  So
D :  If we happy with designers they points any money if we don't have t.
D :  But if there's anything you think we've raised out and then
D :  Yeah i feel free to have it maybe
D :  I mean obviously would be bigger so we might be more space for the slogan on the front

D :  New
D :  Material that we've got
C :  Oh okay a one
A :  Can you go
D :  I've
C :  Wonder which so
A :  "'s" front touch
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So mm
B :  Yeah
C :  The real issue that
B :  Yeah
D :  Well could you that's that's about it
B :  So um
D :  Sorry
B :  So now is the final evaluation find a valuation of the o. of our product
D :  Uh-huh
B :  How we are going to means
B :  I i quite standard word standard or whether it can be so standards or not
B :  How um are trading we will give you these products
B :  So of course this a little bit teamwork what we do that i have to decide what we're trading we will give you this product and everything
B :  So but material d. a. will tell you can work this is we're going to discuss all this do it
B :  Give give it into this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not
B :  This product
B :  Then trends
B :  Yeah they do you guys but if a latest fashion trend somewhat
B :  Means hand because we already stated that
B :  People do graph of fashionable things nowadays
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So this is uh very important factor for evaluation also
B :  Then marketing strategy of the company has we already discussed that
B :  A company is quite rare bird in the market not only in terms of providing quality products not only incorporating latest technology is but also in terms of writing in my mind turns uh
D :  So i right
B :  Yeah so i think what does it in terms of providing environment that's a product um yeah like uh keeping it keeping in mind all the safety issues
B :  So mm
B :  Now comes the criteria meeting with seven point scale
B :  I'm having this year hmm
B :  This scale
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So we have to
B :  Do it on a board
D :  Okay
C :  Right okay the board working again
B :  You should use it for the user requirement
B :  Uh-huh
B :  I think
A :  Do you have the uh the marker work
C :  Mm
B :  Yes uh-huh
D :  Um
C :  Mm
A :  But it's
B :  Thank you
B :  Uh-huh
B :  So uh-huh
B :  Mm mm
B :  Uh-huh
B :  So
B :  These are the three great a good ideas about evaluation of our product
D :  Uh-huh
B :  First of all the outcomes the user requirement
B :  So we will see whether this product miss all the user requirements or not
B :  I i were first i would like to have you ever use or do you think that they were yours or user requirements or not
D :  Um
B :  Yeah
D :  I think
D :  Yeah it did
B :  It's
D :  It had all the basic buttons that they needed
D :  As well as the and new technology that people said they wanted
D :  Um as a
C :  And the user requirement is essentially just to operate a t. v. so
D :  Does it why uh
D :  Yeah
D :  So
C :  Of course we haven't
B :  So we're trading you are personally do
D :  I would say seven
B :  Seven yeah
D :  It sounds good ideas that we have true or false know a search one
A :  One
B :  Wow
C :  Yeah
D :  It's true
B :  Ah one is means highest ranking
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay but i can i was thinking is seven or one
C :  No it's it's like true's one and
A :  No it's four
B :  Okay right
C :  Also so
B :  Right so it's one far from your point of view
D :  I think it's a one
D :  Yep
B :  And where do you say or
B :  Investors
A :  Ah
B :  It's working
A :  It's hard to know how you
A :  You're a two
B :  Hi that you can you can get on on they like
B :  I think she has given the have views on the basis of design was she was a very interface expert radio can give your be used his own technology that that the technology me is the requirements of the customers or not
A :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  Yeah i think it it might even exceeded um
A :  But i guess there's kind of a shortage of buttons
A :  See i wanna give it a two
B :  And white board uh you brian
C :  Well go for one um
B :  You're gonna go for but
C :  Basic requirements part of the pro of the project
B :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  From a a personally it is everything fine it maybe having good design it may be a meeting all they are requirements of the customers like it technology wise price for it but there's one thing we its limits to customers like
B :  We are having one or two two designs like we have everyone banana design
B :  And the other one is audience
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And
C :  Okay
D :  Yeah l. a.
B :  Uh yellow and
B :  And it third one is what to the that is not of a fruit look
C :  I
D :  Oh
B :  But if the person that i like a banana out all ends you're limiting and
C :  On it was uh
D :  Oh
B :  No don't buy a were very because we had that we like this only
D :  Okay
B :  So we actually know a preference for a particular fruit
B :  Two or three kinds that and
C :  Being for test
B :  Yeah as though
D :  It's not it's not not trends
B :  Ah
B :  No uh uh personal yeah the marketing expert i don't believe that because whatever companies a lot of their products in the shape of fruits to give a range of products so they they of shaped like a way see a look at this well as think of is to operate a given radio different things some to do like the way banana shape so my project somebody one pineapple shape some more a shape so you can only as watch a paper somewhere like so in this case giving only one or two traces we are leaving limiting all customers and by limiting then we are landing i would say the same thing over profit also
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Oh
D :  But in electronics i think it's not always quite say
D :  Um you don't always have so many choices is with top
D :  I think in a if you going to buy t. v. maybe
D :  The company all have
D :  The you can choose from a company on have two or three
D :  Traces
D :  But the different designs we'll come up with one product
B :  Uh maybe okay but
D :  No i mean i i always say your opinion on trying to
B :  I if i if there's no they
C :  Yeah
B :  Well i'd give it to ending we are today
D :  Okay
B :  So
B :  We can
B :  Yeah or that i really can't think people say well as maybe
B :  Three or four
B :  Ah now sorry it should be
C :  Five or six
D :  What it a
B :  And also every sorry sorry sorry we are doing the wrong thing
A :  Oh really
D :  I dunno
A :  An average them
B :  Yeah yeah we are together in and there's either taken into a totally yeah yeah i pay for for the sake silence i want so you have one right exactly so we can say one or two
D :  Uh
A :  So a seven for this
A :  No one point
A :  One point eight
D :  Okay
B :  And because it is one point eight
B :  That's a thing too so we will
C :  Oh i see
B :  Do uh-huh yeah
A :  Yeah ran it up to
D :  Okay yeah
B :  So
A :  Mm that right
B :  I were to trends
A :  To explain we you wanna street there
B :  Sorry
A :  How how conforms to the current trends
B :  Yeah again that the president there's there's also like that it it will be fashionable to have these products in the it yeah and the fruit shape or something
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah
D :  Well um
D :  They are in mind that the specifications are we had to frame vegetables are quite popular
D :  And
D :  That people like something
D :  That is good to look at it and not many buttons
D :  Oh i would give it it's
D :  Um well
D :  Because it's hard to make a fruit
D :  Good to look at the the like school you know
D :  So i was
B :  Mm
D :  Actually give it
D :  A three
D :  Hmmm that the three or four much so
D :  Three go for three
B :  Okay yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah as far as the other technology it's got the latest trends in speech technology but it's missing
A :  The screen
A :  And you said uh
A :  Um but those are the pushbuttons
A :  And the scroll buttons
A :  Um but doesn't have that fancy solar power in the
A :  The vibrating energy mechanisms like in uh
A :  A four i give it a little the road for
D :  Hmm
A :  Technology
C :  Yeah um sort of pretty that
C :  Just a fruit does me and i mean uh
D :  Hmm
B :  Yeah i
C :  It may be trendy to some uh i'm just not small and the fruit so um
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh also uh i would like to see in the l. c. d. screen in it
C :  Um
C :  So yeah i'd say but
C :  Four as well
B :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  That's a v. a. that
B :  Uh i think that
B :  In terms of times is where it's uh quite good like
B :  They supporters i mean fruit shape because that's where people are not another face are there shows that people like everything else uh everything that is being advertised like those shows and everything is being able to it in the form of fruit and veggie they were all getting them "'cause" some as it is or showing some association with that
B :  So and in this a a product is good
B :  And the second thing know people don't want any complicated or bulky project and i will say is quite
B :  Simple and quite handy
D :  Hmm
B :  So that is also said that also
B :  Our product me steve to face or or terms of the market
B :  And
B :  Yes it is call spongy also
B :  So they can play be taped it's quite good so then i think maybe
B :  I can give it to
B :  So
B :  All right and type in time and ah
B :  So we can
B :  Is it fine
B :  So what what company strategy
B :  So
A :  Well it was yellow
D :  Um
C :  I
D :  Yeah that kinda nice to see okay
D :  Um
D :  Those lot discuss think that's good
D :  Um i feel i got my say
D :  Um say i'd give the company strategy
D :  Uh
D :  Two
B :  Okay
A :  Well i think it's the the remote control conforms to the
A :  The company strategy
D :  Okay
A :  Is that the question
D :  Is that okay
D :  Okay so you
D :  One two
A :  Yeah
D :  What okay i'm just fine
A :  I go to
B :  So work or you're right
C :  Um yeah i had three
C :  Get to the company strategy so i would go for a
C :  Uh one as we know only
C :  Get to it but we were limited by
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yeah
B :  And uh
B :  Meow so like this product me a um a uh we uh and dismiss all the companies today to make our product should be as well customers requirement as but let us technology and it it should be wiring to save
B :  So says our product we use all these requirements i would also preferred to be with
B :  Rank one
B :  So
B :  For six weeks
A :  So no one uh huh
D :  Yeah one
B :  Off so we can say two or one sure
A :  Yeah two
B :  Okay
B :  So
B :  So uh so uh oh
B :  Mm
B :  Uh well uh we are getting two point three something what we can round it has to
D :  Okay
