C :  Well matched
C :  Okay
C :  So this is a
C :  First meeting of
C :  This design project
C :  Um
C :  And
C :  I am like to show you the agenda for the meeting
C :  I don't know if it was saying round
C :  To you
D :  Mm yeah
C :  Then you know anyway
D :  And the receiver "'kay"
C :  This is the the plan for today's meeting is
C :  Um faceplate us to introduce the project
C :  Briefly
C :  Um although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already
C :  But in the main purpose is to say that we get to know each other a little bit more
C :  Um
C :  Can we want to practice using some of the tools that will be using doing the the course of the design project in the meetings
C :  Um specifically the whiteboard
C :  The the the
C :  Um then we need to go through uh
C :  These specifics of am project plan
C :  And and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it
C :  And they and that's it it's so we've got twenty five minutes to do that but until eleven twenty five
C :  So any
A :  She
C :  Any questions
D :  Look at this point
C :  Not at this point
C :  Sorry this is our project
C :  What we're aiming to do
C :  Is to create a new
C :  Remote control for television
C :  Um we want it to be something original
C :  Something trendy and also something user-friendly
C :  So it has to be quite intuitive that
C :  People are able to use this product
C :  The uh
C :  Method that we going to use
C :  To um
C :  Complete the project
C :  That has sorry
C :  Components as such
C :  There is
C :  The functional design
C :  Of the uh
C :  The remote control
C :  We're going the way we would do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together
C :  For meetings to to work on that
C :  And similarly with the conceptual design
C :  We'll
C :  Start off by working individually it but their own
C :  Expertise on our laptops in a more bring what we've done together
C :  Um and then the detailed design will come huh
B :  Mm
C :  Oh
C :  We called altogether
A :  I'm a bit confused about the what's the difference between the functional design conceptual design uh
A :  Is it just uh uh more detail uh lands on it
C :  I think that we talking that the functional design is more
C :  You all oh
C :  Um area of things way you will be
C :  We want to look at
C :  What functions we need in the remote control and what what specific
A :  Right
C :  Things that it has to do the conceptual design is
C :  Um perhaps be given that as an includes the
A :  How how it will be done
C :  How people are going to users and and
C :  Kind of thing
A :  So
A :  But we do we identify the components of our
A :  Well product um i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase out there and the
A :  It's in the conceptual design phase that the identify of the components of our product
C :  Um i think we'll we'll start
C :  That initially with the functional design
A :  Okay
C :  Already but then
C :  Okay so that's just a brief overview of the the project itself
C :  Um
C :  What i'd like us to do now is
C :  Simultaneously introduce ourselves and
C :  Start using some of the tools that we using for for the project
C :  Specifically the whiteboard
C :  So it
C :  Each person into then
C :  I'd like us to go up to the white board that that panes just underneath it there
C :  And
C :  Draw your favourite animal
C :  And then tell everyone what
C :  Your favourite characteristics of that animal huh
C :  And one you doing dash
C :  Tell us your name what your role is and perhaps how you are animal would like to the road you're taking in this project
B :  Well i looking at me
C :  I
D :  Yeah yeah yeah
A :  I yeah
C :  Would you like to go first
B :  And do i have to uh use
C :  I
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay oh well things falling into a wide okay
C :  Oh
C :  Yeah
C :  Put them pockets
B :  Cool
C :  You don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time
B :  Okay
B :  Say my name's cat
B :  And i mean you know very good at this whole going malarkey
C :  Yeah yeah yeah
B :  Say
B :  Um mm yeah
B :  Okay
D :  Uh-huh okay
A :  Yeah
C :  Scott now is
B :  Oh good point
B :  All ties always within that
B :  Right okay what uh oh sorry
B :  Okay cool
B :  Um this is a rabbit
D :  Yeah
A :  I
B :  I
C :  I thought it might be a cat
D :  Yeah well or is it at at first i thought it was going to be kept it
A :  I
B :  Yeah i i really is very not so make it look you have a
D :  Yeah and i know ions and uh yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh huh huh
C :  I can see but ideas
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay right it's a fluffy rubber
B :  They've got this thing come in blue that unit
B :  Um okay and i like it because it's small
A :  No
B :  And it's left a
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And one day you be able to just a genetically modified um and i will come in think
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Oh ha ha
B :  Okay
C :  Excellent um what's it what's your role within that in
B :  Ah right um be um and in the middle
B :  Well
B :  Top and the key okay cool i'm the marketing expert
B :  Um say like
B :  I'm gonna be doing be apparently according to the middle on the computer is everything
B :  The user requirements specification of the functional design um trendwatching in the conceptual design
B :  Um sports event evaluation in the detailed design
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
B :  Um it's okay yeah
C :  And more about yourself you're from
B :  Um i'm from last uh
B :  Um second yeah
B :  Um
B :  Well stuart sorry
B :  I like sports
B :  Um yeah or a picks kick boxing spinning um
B :  And uh
C :  But not with a rabbit
B :  Not with our bits then you know and that's i like that as well
B :  And yeah um and i like a tends to think want
C :  Excellent to match the rabbit
B :  Cool
B :  I
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Hmm
D :  Okay
D :  Um so my name is mark are
D :  Yes okay okay
C :  "'cause" that and if you didn't have much enough for "'em" that so anyway sit there and you can
D :  Yeah well alright can make it smaller
D :  Uh set an um and the interface design in this project
D :  And my favourite animal i'm i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so so very um
D :  Familiar with all kinds of animals but i do like dogs oh sorry maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Um well there are different kinds of talks okay
D :  Uh
D :  But
D :  I
A :  Yes or no that well yeah yeah
C :  Oh that looks like a dog
D :  Okay
B :  Is it over press a number of it i think it needs for like that it's gonna work in
D :  Yeah maybe it has some of the patches
B :  If if it
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Um yeah and i do like dogs because they are good friends
C :  The rubber legs are on the other side
D :  Two people and they e. l. l.
D :  Mm
D :  Well as compared to small animals like cats um very much more fun because they are not so independent
C :  Hmm
D :  Um
D :  Yeah maybe maybe the fact that they
D :  Protect their homes one
D :  Yeah
D :  Um what it has to do was that was my role in the project is hard say uh i hope to be loyal to the project trends
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Not uh
D :  Not so and left people are doing similar project know the details or project or something
D :  Yeah
C :  I'm where where you're from
D :  I'm from a seven year um
C :  Estonia
D :  Yep
D :  Um so is there anything else you'd like to add alright my role is um so and in the different um
D :  Stages of the design so at first i would responsible for
D :  Um for
D :  Yeah it in designing the technical functions of um
D :  Um on the remote control
D :  Uh then in the uh in the conceptual design the states are in need to
D :  Um come up was uh interface concept
D :  And then in the last um states
D :  Uh i would be responsible for being in fit for the user interface design
D :  Mm
A :  Thank you
D :  Okay that's good
A :  Okay
A :  Mm to some
A :  Either of the features
C :  Yeah
A :  The drawings to
A :  Okay um my name is colours
A :  Ah um
A :  Alright favourite animal
A :  Well my favourite animal is is that how how important know like yellow control as well
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  Hmm
B :  Yeah
C :  Good luck
A :  I
A :  Uh this is going to be in
B :  You know just like a big round body and then somebody skinny legs and then just simple ones
A :  Yeah i don't know okay so let them draw the body first
B :  Okay
A :  We don't would be really skinny legs
B :  I
C :  I
A :  And the what a long tail
B :  If
A :  And the whole face
C :  I
D :  Uh-huh
C :  It's leading
B :  It is like a euro
A :  And there is some grass there
C :  Yeah
B :  But
C :  Yeah
A :  So this is what i like about
A :  No it's i
D :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah i
A :  They they just keep sitting there eating grass to do not this tell anybody
B :  Or just go through all
C :  Uh huh
A :  Um they're kind of put this to know where
B :  Mm
C :  I
A :  I
A :  So um yeah i like i was
A :  Uh um my and my role in the project is a um
A :  I'm the industrial designer so i'm supposed to design all the
A :  Details off off the product
A :  Um how how it works and uh whatever so and you during the functional role what are the various functions that have reform buy it
A :  And during the um conceptual design or the release components of it
A :  And um
A :  Finally i'm not sure about was the last part
A :  Um them
A :  Detailed design i i guess it will again be
A :  The identification of the components are holding it could be cheaper
A :  Um
A :  I'm from india
A :  Um i'm doing my p. h. d. in like linguistics i said at the department psychology
C :  Excellent
A :  Thank you
D :  Thanks
C :  Right now it now it's my turn obviously
A :  Uh
C :  Okay he's a space
A :  Just like a cult i
D :  It looks very very key it's
C :  Yeah i like the cat
A :  Oh
D :  Yeah
C :  I'm jane
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Um i like dogs to it but i do that already because uh contra broke as well as u. k. and
D :  Uh-huh
C :  I like
C :  Hmm
B :  Is that is it
A :  Hmmm norway a
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Yeah yeah
D :  Well
C :  To get cover
D :  I like uh huh okay
A :  Uh yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Is the different
D :  Is it at uh they also like lizards or are they yeah they are
C :  There
C :  Yeah but that's a kind of lizard
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And i i i like
C :  Yeah "'cause" because they remind me of warm places and
D :  I'll uh huh
A :  Uh-huh
C :  And
C :  Where i was living
C :  In cambodia they used to live
C :  In my house and i were on the ceiling and that would make the locator noises
D :  Uh-huh
D :  I hope we don't like snakes to yeah
C :  In the evening
C :  I don't like snakes i come from a stranger um we have nasty snakes
D :  Okay okay
D :  Uh-huh
C :  It's from from last year
C :  I'm from l. but
C :  And
C :  I'm your project manager for
C :  Today
C :  And my role is basically two
C :  Keep things going and make sure that you all
C :  What together
C :  In a production price of that by the end of the day we come up with a great product
D :  One of
C :  Okay
A :  Thank you
C :  So let's see what's next in that
C :  Powerpoint presentation
C :  Uh i just thought yeah i've just thought about this that we could even put it
B :  If you like click on it you can
C :  Much more proficient i was
B :  He
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah like uh
C :  Okay so this is the um overall budget for
C :  Ah
C :  Project
C :  We've got
C :  Um we're planning to sell these remote controls for its make it go away
C :  That means we've got five minutes
C :  Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each
C :  Um
C :  And with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros
C :  And that's selling them on the international market not just in the u. k.
C :  Um so to do that
C :  Um fine and some people estimate that we need
C :  Production costs of the maximum
C :  Twelve and a half euro
C :  So that we can write that
C :  Profit at that
C :  So that's
C :  Something to keep in mind with the designing
C :  Okay
C :  Hmm
C :  This uh let me just skip ahead to say that last thing okay
C :  We've only got a couple of minutes
C :  Does anyone have any
C :  First ideas to bounce around about
C :  Um what we thinking of this
D :  Yeah
C :  Remote control
D :  I'm just wondering what that what that there is like any special feature that we
D :  Want to have "'em" want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones
C :  Uh-huh
C :  I think that
C :  Probably something that
C :  It's best if we take away with this but if we all have a think
C :  When we go away from the meeting
C :  What specific things could be
C :  Um
C :  Included in this remote control that
A :  I think uh in the beginning uh one thing was that was mention was that it should be more trendy user-friendly an additional
C :  A rash of the ordinary
A :  So
A :  Uh i think your point is valid as far as originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are
A :  Quick unique to this
C :  Something something yeah
B :  Yeah i was looking at the website any of the things
B :  That they've made a nine i put down some like inspirational words like that i got from
B :  Looking at the pictures
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Say the mouse say is um we put the fashion in electronics
B :  And um says something that is silly and stylish but it's still functional
C :  Uh-huh
B :  You need some kind of thinking in a like those findings so they have
B :  The new generation ones whether they're actually how many buttons on them and stuff like that
A :  Alright
C :  Huh
B :  Unit say something edging towards that so it's not a very
B :  I mean i know what a mess the button to oh my remote controls are could have need you need to me
C :  Uh-huh
C :  So perhaps some sort of menu by staying alive
A :  Mm
B :  So there was a little less crowded and it's like i mean you need theoretically you could you all kinds of things you t. v. right but what the most people they they turn it on they watch certain specified channels
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Yep
B :  In a in a in a turn it off again
A :  There's a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time
B :  Sometimes okay maybe
B :  Yeah so
C :  Yeah
B :  Does may need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do
C :  So
C :  No
C :  It could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And then use the
B :  So if you're kinda sad case the nays higher may control works
C :  Mm
B :  Then you need that's fine then you can do on the screen or than anybody else i don't have these buttons which is confusing
A :  Mm
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Excellent
B :  "'cause" like if you look at the train it's just very light
B :  There's no extra bit some at the train on the website
B :  And that uh if you can put up on the thing
C :  I haven't had a look at it
B :  Um but it's just like a long
B :  One thing you some new meeting people but it looks really pretty t.
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Right
C :  Any other immediate for
A :  Mm
C :  Before we
C :  Hmmm along
A :  Oh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something that that "'cause" the high battery life although i don't think that the um it's a huge problem for remote controls and in a battery life uh
C :  Uh-huh
A :  I mean on then you need to the place of our trees
C :  Yeah
A :  Um
D :  But uh i mean a even though it has to be record so we shouldn't ago would
A :  Yeah
D :  Like too far away from from the user wants because otherwise then you use as well just have a lot of problems all of
A :  Yeah
A :  The big learning curve yeah
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Learning yeah yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  So we should kind of fit in as well and uh
C :  It's like there's fancy website
A :  Just tear type of uh yeah
D :  Uh-huh
C :  But
C :  You can't access because you have no idea how to get mean that the designers not a great
C :  Uh okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with with this
C :  Um
C :  We've got another meeting in thirty minutes
C :  So
C :  You will you be getting specific instructions once you go back to your work space for them
C :  Basically
C :  You're looking at the working design
A :  Okay
C :  You're looking at the technical functions design
C :  And for you it's the user requirements
C :  Specification like to start
C :  Okay
D :  Okay
C :  Thanks for that
D :  Thank you
C :  Well see you in half an hour
D :  See
C :  Carry the laptop back again do we need to unplug think it's
C :  Probably
