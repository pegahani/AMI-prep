A :  Mm
B :  Okay
A :  Alright well
A :  Welcome sorry
A :  It should be the last of these meetings and uh huh looks like we've uh
A :  Than a good job here and uh
A :  We'll discuss with be the final one
A :  The final v. channels
A :  Um
A :  Okay nicole the um
A :  That that that is the last meeting uh and not take theirs right
A :  Um
A :  Okay the um
B :  Uh-huh
A :  The the next uh
A :  Then we'll we'll we'll have a look at the uh the topic of the prototypes and uh
A :  Okay the uh evaluation criterion finance and then uh
A :  Yeah just whatever production and um
A :  And then winkler use
A :  Um
A :  So if i if if you'd like to a presidential
A :  Well proposals
B :  Okay we basically have the same kind of buy and here's just um you hold it like this i think it's kind of moulded to the to the shape of your hand basically
B :  Um uh the last we've got these scroll for the volume
B :  On the right we have buttons for the channels up and down an actress you can hold it in scroll you can hold it in and watch
B :  Uh this is d. power key um it's going to be guess you know turn on
A :  Uh huh
B :  Ah that's the little menu team
B :  This is the infrared section so you can it'll be sending raise here you know pointing like that can send it or if you hold it up like that it'll send it
A :  Yep
A :  Yeah
A :  Good good
B :  Uh i've got a microphone there which for all the voice command seeking a talk to like that it'll still in the centre
A :  Uh huh
B :  Um the logo was down hmm down there
A :  Uh huh
B :  Um in her is has the cover on it you can see they could just kind of goes the right that's the cover a car goes over everything and there's holes for the buttons to come through
A :  Yep yep
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
C :  And so we figured it would be kind of in a lightweight plastic just kind of a light
A :  Yeah yep yep
C :  Uh-huh nondescript grey so that people wanna buy the covers and then the covers all be that sort of rubbery material like p. make ipod covers
A :  Yep
C :  So they can add the structure over
A :  Yeah
B :  Mm
A :  Shame each other a lot on top of those are like
B :  I
C :  Yeah well i i didn't have any other kind of you just never rubbery and that way you know spongy like it's something that people wanted
A :  No sir yeah
A :  Uh huh
B :  Yeah
A :  O. k.
A :  Yep
A :  Right
C :  And it to sort of structures over and the way i think probably hope to protect a little bit too as well yeah
B :  But it's also easier plumbers like a lock of rejection have to screw them on stuff you can smell to get some to do it for you this is the energy just illustrated over yourself and it'll be fine
A :  Okay
A :  Yeah
C :  You just kind of structured over
A :  Yeah okay good yeah
C :  And all those stay on and then the buttons come through and
B :  Yeah
C :  So and then that each one of a monetary and a half the logo with the yellow circle one r. r.
A :  He up right
B :  A little bit the covers as well
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  I mean are they this a city celp when i just one that i mean how how well people put least then we found that
A :  Right
A :  Yeah k. i. so if that's that's the same size increase that in my mind that that button and basically but uh
B :  Maybe it's dan yeah
C :  Uh
A :  And
B :  We can broaden the promenade it so it would stands like that
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah no "'cause" if it if if it if it's a good at it as a as a fashion item
B :  Yeah i mean it's standing
A :  Uh uh i mean is it's uh i this is um is just a minor d. so points um this is a just databases a bit bigger and uh
B :  Yeah we just one out uh a
A :  Yeah and uh adjust these other uh another idea somewhere is is uh is this all
A :  It is "'cause" people the option if if if they've got on
B :  Uh-huh
A :  No um if it's because we might actually have several lined up on the yeah
D :  That one spare one
B :  Mm yeah yeah that uh we just link then i guess it comes down to base the hand and flat and um
A :  Yeah well
C :  Yeah
D :  You know
C :  Yeah that's just kind of
A :  Yeah but that that's so uh but uh they would be be there for older
B :  So it uh
C :  What does make a little
B :  Yeah i
A :  Yeah cool concept is uh
C :  Some more like that
A :  Yeah yeah no no i mean that's a these uh
B :  Yeah
C :  So it's just sort of
B :  No no i don't have to like that so it kind in your hands channels and have it there yeah yeah yeah i like that like that uh
D :  Yeah i can add uh
D :  Cat and natural kind of idea words like
C :  Yeah
D :  More of a kind of
D :  Like a baby so i think they're yeah i can like that kind of look like like a like a flower power plant
A :  Yeah
A :  But uh
A :  Yeah but never but they they they that but
B :  Mm
D :  For the more natural yeah
C :  But still be powered to
A :  Yeah yeah yeah i mean if it's a wouldn't wouldn't do that in to it yeah
B :  I
B :  The final product would actually stand up yeah but
C :  Yeah
A :  But the but that there to put it this will minor minor minor d. sell something the uh the basic
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah so
B :  Yeah
A :  Concept is is is actually going on
B :  Mm hmm
A :  And it is so nice a comedy routine they're they're they're looking difference
B :  Mm
C :  Yeah
A :  Um so a good that's that that's excellent
A :  Um
A :  Right so it's as um
A :  What's on the next one
A :  A watch uses to look at the um
A :  Fine and this um now
A :  We're gonna have to design brief
A :  Uhuh
A :  Find me a spreadsheet top
D :  Yeah yeah yeah
A :  Was uh
D :  And uh
D :  Maximise
A :  Oh right
A :  Right
A :  Good this is what we need make these things simple so the the yeah the the the boss can understand
B :  I
A :  Yeah i would i have um no this is a companies
A :  Uh
A :  Uh costing
A :  For for various uh
A :  Aspects of design
A :  And uh that that teaches some of these slightly uh
A :  Literally given the constraints placed on those um of an effort for instance if if they require was to have it in the corporate colours than that it a special colour that's uh
A :  That's a standard colour
A :  Um so we're just simply on batteries
A :  The the the want they want decision that had to make is that so um
A :  Where it we will have to find a city make it a standard chip to to do this with
A :  And uh the i. b. m.
A :  Tom tom tom so that they they all and so
A :  Um the that i don't think is a a serious problem for the uh the the voice sensor is uh is expensive but we we made a a basic decision no that's absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that
A :  That has to stay
A :  Um
A :  And again the the the the shape of the case means it's it's expensive to
A :  Um
A :  Is it to make "'cause" we did the double curve spot on the other hand because a lot a full fashion concept
A :  Um we we should exceed the the sales targets
A :  Um
A :  Yeah it's internet or plastic so that that's uh that's no problem
A :  And uh
A :  Um just because i also get the the colour of the
A :  The whole thing that's uh
A :  Yeah that's um cost uh
A :  Um and so uh
A :  When i should a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and then the simple uh
A :  Um
A :  Slide uh so
A :  Um and then the the buttons alright
A :  Uh
A :  I don't know the special colour anyway be the cost is that come in at at exactly on target twelve point five
A :  Uh but uh i so i think we have a a very strong case to argue that's uh
A :  What what we'd call c. system in a in a that's it
A :  And uh and and difference that um any any slide to compromise we have to make on
A :  On cost is offset by the uh maybe
A :  Uh yeah the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and then having the the interchangeable
A :  Covers so uh
A :  Um yeah i agree
A :  If if if the marriage can expect us to be taken who personally i can also or fairly get technologically innovative
A :  Um that they they have to accept that we we cooperate absolutely within the the constraints are they gave so you uh
A :  We we we present this is the uh the company's uh
A :  The the company's way forward and uh
A :  Yeah but i think we can argue that we we have
A :  Uh coming on
A :  On top just
A :  Um
A :  Make a name
A :  Uh
A :  So um
A :  Does anybody want to uh a hundred what what what do you want standards and
A :  Yeah
D :  Evaluation
A :  We have the evaluation where where yeah well well where where where where where act
D :  That the product or the project
A :  They did be well the the the product
D :  And
D :  Well
D :  Oh my presentation sure
A :  Yeah
D :  Sure a kind yeah
A :  Oh sorry yeah mm mm
B :  Uh-huh
A :  More and clicks in the microphone
D :  There you go
D :  This evaluation of the product was the
D :  Just see the middle one
D :  Criteria all the conditions that we said that uh
D :  Since it's the self
D :  From the point you that the consumer the management
D :  What i can uh sit it is
D :  On the whiteboard
D :  M. k. each
A :  Mm
A :  What
D :  Our team or spots
D :  See these questions
D :  But still one seven one being true and seven being
D :  I think false
A :  Seventeen hours when i'm number two uh two
D :  Yeah
D :  And then at the end steak average
A :  Want that
A :  True and seven to fly is
D :  Yes i
B :  I
C :  Huh
B :  Something
D :  So uh
D :  Some of these questions
D :  Is the device flashy and fashionable
A :  Well i think most definitely
C :  I think it is yeah
B :  Yeah that's a definitely a one yeah
D :  So uh huh
D :  And also but uh huh
D :  Technologically innovative
A :  Yes the post technology into it
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Easy to use
A :  Can't seem to make it any easier
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh suitable for concern
D :  Some
A :  To to look
B :  Yeah that's right
C :  Yeah i think it made me mad all of the consumer
B :  Yeah
C :  One it's
D :  Uh it's a complicated
A :  No
C :  No
D :  Today well so far
D :  Uh functional
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah definitely
C :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  Right
A :  Very can easily
A :  And some yeah i mean
D :  Built in the
D :  The speech where are you function
A :  That's that's
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Very long to learn to use shouldn't
B :  No no no
D :  And um what else
D :  R. s. i. e.
D :  There's the car standards well
A :  Less buttons are most but
B :  Oh
D :  We was yep so
B :  Yeah
D :  It was a bit actual effort to
B :  That's it is so the the handle more gonna be correct as well
C :  Yeah
A :  Uh yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  On on
D :  Um what was it at all age groups
A :  I think it will all because a minute older older people in common is the buttons anyway we're actually probably like that but
B :  Uh-huh
C :  So
D :  Yeah
D :  Uh speaker yeah
A :  Not the voice that's uh
D :  Oh we have to do the dishes are saying that
D :  Old people be less likely to be extra money but function the increase functionality easy easy to use a device make the company
B :  Mm
A :  I guess it's it's what i tend to actually
A :  Charging a particular premium anyway in the end so
B :  I think it will tend to appeal more to younger age groups just "'cause" we have gone with the fashion focusing younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah mm yeah
B :  But um i think it's still p. or a certain level to everybody yeah
A :  It'll appeal to a different for different reasons but it's it's uh
C :  Yeah i think that's just the simplicity of it and
B :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  So are they are there are
C :  Not having to learn to programme on on having you know
B :  Mm hmm
A :  Yeah
A :  So
C :  A million buttons
B :  Yeah
A :  Or think we can reason is a reasonable
A :  Another one one out
B :  I think
D :  Uh you can just click and minus five euros next page
D :  Yeah yeah and what they did we make a nice lunch
A :  In a in a in in my interpretation of management instructions
A :  Uh is uh yes it it nice economist is television only it's it's simple to use
B :  Mm
A :  Um it's it's it's but in but just
C :  And the the cost
A :  Um i think it's uh
A :  Yes so than than any any minor points we
A :  But we ah okay
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So our power thing with
A :  Than an amazing job and uh
B :  But don't know is
A :  Coming up with what
D :  So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
D :  Eleven divided by parents want this
C :  Yeah i
B :  I
D :  Because average of one
A :  Um what can we need need a calculator for that
B :  Uh-huh
D :  And that
D :  Roughly concludes my evaluation of the
A :  Then they can be like a table that way
D :  Well the product
B :  Hmmm no
A :  Oh
C :  I think we got
A :  Related to um
A :  Are you if you want to say anything
B :  Uh
C :  Mm
A :  So my yeah
B :  Uh-huh
C :  I don't think so i mean i think we worked well together and looked really it was the consumers want that one were trying to make can
A :  Nah
B :  I think
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  You know seem to discuss things pretty well then come to a group consensus mm
B :  Uh-huh
A :  Well so assuming that this this slide here i mean they've satisfaction with their room for creativity i mean i think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as they
B :  Definitely
A :  Uh the the product
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  I'll i was um i won't comment on leadership
A :  And teamwork i think we've uh
A :  Minimum is uh
A :  Worked pretty well together
A :  Um with the spec a wheel whiteboard digital pens
A :  Uh i think the results speak
A :  For itself
A :  And new ideas found that um again give a given
A :  Relatively
A :  Every day product
C :  Yeah
A :  A thing with a very uh very effectively come up with a menu uh
A :  Uh a new approach
A :  Um not costs within budget yes is the project evaluated we we're all happy that shouldn't be meets all the criteria
A :  Um
A :  Yeah
A :  Mm
A :  Thank you very much indeed i think
C :  Alright
B :  Thank you
A :  I think that so
C :  Yeah um
B :  Hmm
A :  Okay we can give a very tough
B :  Okay
A :  For one call the meeting produced
C :  Okay
B :  With
A :  Not for a for a t. shirt the world and
