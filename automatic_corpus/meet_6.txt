A :  Uh-huh
C :  Okay
A :  Okay everyone's ready
A :  So we are here for uh
A :  Are uh functional design
A :  Okay
A :  So we are yeah for the functional design meeting you
A :  So
A :  First i will show d. at the end that so
A :  We'll we'll uh i will take notes during this meeting so
A :  I will try to surmise it
A :  And put
A :  That's a marine the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards
A :  So then uh
A :  Each of you will uh early the presentation on the task
A :  But there's been a required class times or user requirement specification technical function design
A :  And working design
A :  Then i will uh present use some new project requirements i received
A :  From uh the them and then you meant board
A :  Then we will take to do this easy and uh and and the remote control uh uh uh indeed functions
A :  And then uh i will assign you
A :  To task for the next
A :  Parts
A :  Of the meeting
A :  Of the of the process
A :  So uh uh want to starts the
A :  The presentation of
A :  What they do
C :  Do you want still
B :  Like a start
A :  We can start
B :  Ah
B :  Do you believe come huh
A :  You have a four point
B :  Should be
B :  In my in there for that no
A :  Yeah yeah maybe there
A :  Okay
A :  Were you
B :  A mac see i think
B :  Mm
A :  Oh
B :  Mm
A :  And mm
C :  Okay
A :  The technical program a
B :  Do things to the in the wrong for the city
B :  It's possible
A :  You put two tons
C :  No
B :  Because some way and something like this little longer than a month or something like this and sit on your son okay
C :  What do you have been told that
B :  Come up
C :  A system too
B :  Yeah go up
A :  Yeah
B :  Again
B :  We're back
A :  Yeah though
B :  Uh maybe this and uh me
B :  But and the
A :  Over
A :  Okay
B :  No there's no i think
A :  There's no
A :  We have it
B :  It's going to
A :  No problem
C :  Yeah otherwise could you just described
B :  I wanted
C :  By hand
B :  Okay
C :  With the the whiteboard
B :  Yeah
A :  If you remember yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  So um basically
B :  What was your as a remote control right
A :  Yeah
B :  So uh and the question will have a look to control so most people want to have a a remote for the hi-fi and t. v. and stuff like that
C :  Uh-huh
B :  And but other people want sounds remotes for uh at controlling the uh and
B :  Boy is like oh but that's in your box stuff
C :  Uh-huh
B :  And uh two plus all wants of remotes for controlling
B :  And the courthouse
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah so there's a project i think cortex how or something like that's that's that's that's
B :  Uh you can integrate the remote with their computers stuff
C :  Uh-huh
B :  So
B :  That one last one thing the other thing is
B :  With uh uh
B :  To find if you sell that by with single whatever
B :  Uh if you how to find the future then you can also have
C :  Okay
B :  Uh at the same time there's any doubt was commands
B :  If you want yeah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  So
B :  I think that's a bit back that in that case
B :  Uh so the user interface uh most of two parts
B :  One's a voice commands
B :  But then what one is the actual buttons but
B :  Uh and of the buttons but would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Sort of buttons for special navigation in space
C :  Uh-huh
B :  So the buttons for
B :  Uh eileen yeah
B :  Access of meeting
B :  And uh as the buttons for on the market is
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah
C :  What do you mean by you know options
B :  Like a a videotape goes for but parts that fast and stuff
B :  Yeah
B :  Uh
A :  Okay so special navigation and
A :  Being accessed when they make sense and there's a false one no
B :  Uh-huh
A :  So the button uh for special allegation
B :  Yeah the facilities for them you might have a t. v. in the menu and you want things yeah
A :  Okay
A :  Then in the access
A :  Then random access
B :  Yeah and also time with that
A :  I yeah i need to okay
B :  Same think
B :  So is that a combined with us when we should put this other buttons for that's
A :  Okay
B :  Yeah
B :  Or we will put either the thing their genetic but uh are there are a lot of uh uh
B :  Remotes on the market right now and it's the screen is more for uh
A :  Okay
B :  Almost everybody has the stuff
A :  Okay and and a voice command you know
B :  Was come on who wants to find think we could not sign any but on a commander in a button
A :  Okay
B :  If we have enough processing power i guess
B :  Yeah
A :  Okay
A :  So that's the that "'cause" you're a investigations
B :  Yeah uh uh yeah i think so so far
A :  Okay maybe we can have a look at the user requirements we've
D :  Yeah
D :  Um i don't know if you
D :  Can
D :  Open to
A :  And i think an opinion
D :  Yeah but it's not too yeah
A :  Maybe you can see
A :  It's
D :  Uh in
A :  Missing uh huh
D :  Hmmm to to actually
D :  Yeah
A :  In which further
B :  Hmmm you do
D :  You
D :  Yeah
A :  Drop get too many sharp form there
D :  But it's not
D :  Mm
A :  Maybe you can send it to me by you may have
A :  Just two parts and one
A :  At i mean
D :  And uh and that's
A :  I'm trying to show it to everyone
A :  That would be more
A :  Or something or
D :  Okay um
A :  Isn't it
D :  It's the second one
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah this is this evening
B :  Oh designer interface
D :  Okay can
A :  Okay
A :  So maybe i can uh switch slides when you whenever you ask
A :  That would be more convenient so okay
D :  Okay so he can you can do
A :  Functional requirements
D :  Okay so
D :  In how well usability that we had so it's the remote control use a monk one hundred subjects
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And this is the subjects also fields
D :  Uh it
D :  Questionnaire eight
D :  Okay
D :  And
D :  Yeah as the results
D :  So you you can see that it's um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
D :  So you we have to find something to
D :  Make them more
D :  More nice more kind
D :  A t. percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
D :  Uh a. t. and red percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look up
D :  That's that's good
D :  Okay so it's not really into it but i i can i can say
D :  Fifty if uh seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot it's
D :  So um we have to uh have a remote control uh
D :  Very um
D :  Out for that
D :  Uh the buttons have had to be um
D :  Uh
D :  Uh makes a reason is resisting to to fox
A :  Okay
D :  Um and fifty percents of shoes of say is the only use
D :  Uh i will ten percent of the of the buttons is um
A :  Okay
D :  In the remote control
D :  So all the buttons we aim
D :  We have to put a
D :  I have to
D :  Twelve
D :  Um they use the real use and that certainly mm
A :  Okay
A :  Okay so few are regions maybe it would be good
D :  Yeah
D :  Not many buttons and uh and uh
D :  Right you
D :  Use a bill buttons
A :  Okay
B :  But what kind of remote controls that
D :  Sorry
B :  What kind of task was it
B :  It was a t. v.
D :  Yeah but
D :  Hmmm wasn't for most used t. v.
A :  Yeah that's in fact we it seems that we are going to make a t. v. remote control
A :  According to new requirements i received from the management wall i would present them in the file a one
B :  A good
D :  Okay you can do so
D :  So
D :  Without the frustrations expect that users
D :  So they say it's the day just
D :  Uh a friend the remote control in
D :  In the room so they want to have uh weight room
D :  Two
A :  To find it
D :  Find it's
A :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  And um a lot of the time is a it takes too much time to learn how to use
A :  Yeah
D :  A new remote control
D :  So they want some things make it very simple and uh
A :  Okay
D :  Easy to use
D :  And uh
D :  Remote controls are bad for
A :  What is it an s. i.
D :  Yes
D :  Um
D :  And
B :  Uh yes i yeah we we your wrist
B :  You can become painfully confront on because
A :  Hi
B :  Yeah
A :  I didn't knew that
B :  If you have to double the computers this position
A :  Okay so we we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah
B :  But have a
D :  Yeah
B :  Have to say ha ha
A :  Instead of it
D :  I
A :  Oh
D :  Uh
A :  Uh sorry
A :  But anything from microsoft
D :  Okay um before that uh i i have some
D :  So um
D :  Some sing
D :  Uhuh
D :  To say before
D :  Um
D :  We know is that uh that "'cause" i use uh um that um remote control um to to challenge is an l.
A :  Yeah
D :  Um
D :  And um to to change the volume selection of uh
A :  Okay
D :  And uh
D :  And that's uh a lot for a settings
D :  For settings their position and then else and uh i think things like that
A :  Okay
D :  So
D :  It's better to put it uh
D :  Uh
D :  Uh something very easy to set set and uh
A :  Yeah
A :  These functions should be very uh access to the
D :  Accessible yes
A :  Yeah okay
A :  This is the main function okay
D :  So then we ask some questions to them and um
D :  Whereas this question if they prefer any c. d. screen or
D :  And the remit each function remotes control and
D :  E. j. i'm
D :  Pay more for speech recognition remote control
A :  Yeah
D :  And you can go and we have euros the results of
D :  Yeah
B :  The first question
D :  Of the uh
D :  Questions
D :  So you know
D :  That um
D :  For the younger
D :  It's very important
A :  Twelve it's at the end of those
D :  To have this s. and speech recognition
D :  And uh
D :  And users that is that some put on but it's uh
D :  We know that uh
D :  Uh people uh between fifteen and twenty five um people who watch a t. v. and it'll mm
D :  Or we can use it uh let's see so uh
A :  Okay
D :  So maybe we we can have this it's recognition mean
A :  Yeah maybe this this is important
A :  Well that
A :  Maybe those uh like this teenager customer can uh advice their parents to buy it
A :  These equipment and so we can
B :  Mm
A :  We have to take care of
A :  That point of view i think
A :  Or so
A :  Yeah
D :  Okay and if there is the conclusion and uh so
D :  As we say before uh i think yeah uh in a remote control like meaning do that you
D :  It's a good thing
A :  Okay
D :  But not too many made that ends liked we we said before
D :  You easy to you uh is uh a a way to find he'd easy in the room
D :  And uh
D :  Uh
D :  Resistance
D :  Two
D :  To sort count two
C :  Uh-huh
D :  True
A :  Okay
D :  Right
A :  Okay design and user
D :  I don't know if you see something else of the time so
C :  I'm just thinking of something
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah
C :  Um
C :  We want to have a know
C :  I don't know it's a good idea we don't have the original a remote control for everything
A :  No
A :  We
A :  Well it seems that we know want to have a t. v. remote control
C :  Okay
A :  From the the management board way we see the the new make
A :  But it would be costly
A :  Uh and and or so we'd it would take more time to develop to have a
C :  Yeah
A :  But you know either you know reach remote control
B :  Um i'm not laughing
B :  The the so called him
C :  Uh-huh
A :  That it would be too long to do that
B :  I think that should be the same
A :  Yeah
A :  Because eh we see that's made from management one
A :  And it seems to tell that's
A :  That's
A :  If we want to be on the market
A :  As early as but see but uh
A :  We should uh focus on t. v. more uh it seems that the market is more important
A :  So maybe it's a good decision i dunno what's your opinion
B :  Oh how of the the um and should know more about how fast can the design
B :  I don't think
C :  Mm
B :  Yeah yeah
C :  Finish tonight
A :  Oh
B :  I can't
C :  But basically yeah maybe yeah
C :  I can continue with my presentation would be a
A :  Okay
C :  You you but i think
C :  We have some technical problems so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control
A :  Maybe you can go to to wait but if you have some going to do you know
C :  Yeah but
C :  Do i have well yeah i have enough cables
B :  Okay
B :  You see a bit like a dog with this
A :  Yeah
C :  Okay so i'm just going to describe in fact fall for remote control this is quite easy we just have
C :  So we can bring
A :  O. k. i. e. okay
C :  Like that's
C :  I'm just going to describe basically we have the battery a power supply here
C :  After that we just have uh and user interface that's yeah that's
C :  Uh
C :  Something that that's which could be the uh l. c. d.
C :  It's a wall um an array of
C :  Pushbutton something like that
C :  Push button or a c. d. after that we we've seen that's into um
C :  And electronic chip
C :  So i say you see the hands
C :  I think that's too uh l. e. d.
C :  Which is a infrared
C :  Um
C :  Which is uh an infra-red um
C :  Components
C :  And so what we fought for myself this for for us this is quite easy
A :  You see as a separate unit
A :  Okay
C :  It it's uh is this just a chip
C :  Which does all of the
C :  Um numerical
A :  Competition
C :  Numerical competition according to your display
C :  And saw forest of this is quite easy we just need to um
C :  Take it to define what we want to do when the user interface
C :  Uh um
C :  Once
C :  Something
C :  And after that we just do it according to spend some time to to to of the not uh to the television
A :  Okay
C :  So far as this is quite easy
A :  Okay so this is quite easy
C :  Yeah and
A :  Isn't that much
C :  We just have to define the processing power that we need
C :  Uh especially if we want to do some uh
C :  Speech recognition in that case but yeah but we are going to use small
B :  And this would be to take more time to do
C :  Simple
C :  Yeah of course of course
C :  And um
C :  But forrest ah no one this is really easy it's a question of
C :  One non sound so
A :  To have um
A :  Use used to kill about voice control
C :  No no no i said
A :  Stand on button one
C :  Yeah star burst a remote control
C :  Takes maybe a one amounts to to do that
B :  So the only time programme user's voice cool so
C :  Yeah definitely
A :  So you have any idea of four wrong it would take to have voice recognition now
C :  I would say
B :  Ten years
C :  Mm
A :  I
C :  And it's a board eight months
C :  To have
C :  The first results
A :  Okay so it
A :  It's a bit long yeah
C :  Yeah okay
C :  Uh
A :  When one's father uh some other one was button
C :  Yeah
A :  Even if we have the u. c. d. display
C :  Yeah even um and this is released on on devices now
C :  Um i think it's
C :  For um speech
C :  Recognition
A :  Okay
A :  Okay so we can take this into account so i would think it would be good to go for uh uh
A :  Like speech recognition
B :  But you don't have time to market
C :  And also a much uh uh i think
A :  Yeah well
B :  I think we should go there
C :  Doing it the kick-off
C :  Meeting you said that we we shouldn't mm
C :  We shouldn't go up to
C :  Twelve point five
C :  Your old are your needs
A :  Yeah
C :  So i'll
C :  On many you need should be sent to the
B :  World
A :  When we each unit as you said uh twenty five euros
C :  Yeah but only yeah
B :  How what college you get how would you want to buy one million units
B :  What how the thousand units
B :  Uh it's it's really need to decide
C :  Yeah
B :  How what the cost for for the file
C :  Usually are they sees less of that to do lost touch it
B :  Okay
A :  Because well
B :  So there we go for a powerful wanna have a good enough for both the films
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah okay
C :  We can
A :  It seems that that we want to say like four million units from the
C :  Uh-huh
A :  First meeting
B :  Okay
B :  For more than uh-huh
A :  Okay maybe we can uh uh we can look at then you requirement that we see from the management board and discussed discussed or function we want to have a
C :  Um
C :  I just had a question uh do you want a constant to present
A :  Yeah it a we continue when
A :  As to question if you want
C :  Um you say that's
C :  I don't remember what else but
C :  Thirty percent
C :  Of the tasted
C :  People say that it's it's quite difficult to
C :  To mm to use of the remote control
D :  Yeah
C :  Do they say uh b. c.'s difficult but for the same reason all do they have all the reason
D :  Well we don't
C :  To to to maybe to keep in mind maybe it to access to of that menu you should do something that that's
D :  Uh oh yeah i i i think is a is a say that it's an difficult to be on the on to use it but we when you know what to use it it's it's okay
C :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
D :  But
A :  It's nothing to see if there's
D :  Yeah
C :  That yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want
C :  You say that i want
C :  I have six buttons
B :  Mm uh a lot of people that uh if you have the l. c. d. screen
C :  Yeah
B :  If you don't
A :  Yeah
B :  A completely the way you want because the buttons was would look
C :  Yeah
B :  The way you want them
A :  But there's so it seems that
B :  But it would be hard to configure mean you might in it
B :  Uh uh so to do something for the expert user
C :  Okay
B :  So
B :  I mean as our markets in my "'cause" i think the young people are lots uh uh uh our uh
B :  "'cause" think yes the the
C :  Yeah
B :  So uh
A :  Yeah
B :  Uh is yeah so for young people and uh it to be called
B :  Did everyone to use it's maybe about two or not but we can figure it i guess i don't know if this study
A :  Maybe it would be more complex to configure it
C :  Yeah
A :  To be simpler
A :  But then that creating a simpler project
B :  And there are other things that if we make something that's important easy to use at this
B :  T. v. news you didn't have to be exactly the same as everything else
B :  Right
C :  Yeah
B :  I dunno why is different and of course it was a solid have to learn to use
B :  First
A :  Yeah
A :  Oh so we we see that that's most people are find it
A :  Find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons
A :  And they mean you use only teach and then this
A :  And volume buttons
A :  So
A :  We made rest uh make a very easy to use a remote control
A :  Was mainly those buttons
B :  Yeah
A :  And
A :  Maybe also uh um
A :  Some lightning stuff too
A :  Because most people are
A :  Find also ought to to find the remote control
A :  Rules that was you take cetera
A :  This is these are these two points on them and frustration so
A :  Maybe if we design so i'm saying
A :  Very simple or
A :  And easy to uh find
A :  When lost
A :  It will uh i the the so use competitive at that age
A :  Without making some seen too complex and too long to leave it up
B :  Uh-huh
A :  But let let us see first the new requirements
A :  So we don't have to um so this
A :  These
A :  Uhuh
A :  He's uh eight
A :  Ease of um in that
A :  This is in the same direction as we wear speaking
A :  So we don't have to make a very complex remote controls
A :  To access teletext and stuff like that
A :  T. v. text
B :  Teletext is just one button
A :  Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to serve
A :  Amongst pages and stuff
B :  You just write uh at the numbers
A :  Yeah
A :  So why
B :  Yeah with the data keys right
A :  Yeah
B :  So
A :  So anyway we don't have to include this feature
A :  Because it's
A :  It's not used anymore by users
A :  They prefer it to
B :  I yeah well um so the the it like but there
B :  I don't see it just one button
A :  Yeah
A :  I know
A :  You see one button used to one more button
A :  If if if we want to make it very soon but we have to redo them a button compared to the to work on to do this
A :  Anyway i have this point we can discuss
A :  Was all
A :  Um
A :  So all as a as a tool before
A :  Uh it would be better if you'd sorry for the t. v.
A :  Uh um
A :  Because we want to be quick and on the market
A :  And then or so we have to make a very uh
A :  Uh uh uh korea that's used uh
A :  This remote control is this popped off off or projects
A :  And throw lock operate uh low will
A :  And and colours and uh and design as where
A :  So that's uh they don't straight as one of
A :  Or product
A :  So this is the the key points
A :  So
A :  Before or uh of the meeting it
A :  We can uh uh define uh
A :  What would be the the characteristic of the the the the of the controller of the remote controller
A :  And
A :  Which would then do we need which function and do we want cetera
B :  But it does
A :  So
A :  Do you um
A :  So so
A :  From from the uh um
A :  The marketing if that i think
A :  The key aspect is the the
A :  Easy to use aspect is should be very simpler
A :  And most we don't know never use only ten percent of the with an hour
A :  I use of fun
A :  So i think we have to do something very simple or anything we all agree on that point no
C :  Uh-huh
B :  What if we didn't to be does the t. v. remote control it's going to be very simple
A :  Yeah okay
A :  So
A :  Yeah that's the point to your is simpler
A :  Maybe uh so few buttons
A :  So and then uh
A :  Volume going for
A :  And what did what function do you see
B :  What if it's going to be a simple as possible and that's the the remote control or not affectionate i can't see
A :  In addition to that
B :  Really
A :  Maybe switch t. v. on and off
B :  Yeah
B :  No you want to do it a little short advertising can do that then you can come back of us
A :  Uh huh
A :  Yeah
B :  Something
A :  Yeah volume
A :  Maybe a mute button
A :  And then
A :  On off button
A :  And that's or
C :  Uh i know that it's some you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh i know
C :  I disco uh that's what i did it
C :  Quick look
C :  Uh but they don't now so that they do something which is quite nice now you have a button you you press it and this is the the previous channel which is come back
B :  So the number it
A :  Okay
A :  Yeah this is crude maybe we can include that so so preach previous channel button
A :  So we have
A :  Like channel button the previous channel button the volume button press the mute
A :  But then
C :  Uh-huh
A :  And uh just the the the traditional on off
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Button
B :  And uh and of course but i'm attending buttons
A :  Yeah i i don't know well that yeah
B :  How should be hard to implement them
B :  Because there could be make out on here but god sentiment that
A :  Yeah
A :  In criminal bad if you need to be because that in new
A :  You switch them
C :  They said that we can do something that that this is uh incremental
C :  But went you press it for a long time you call five by five
A :  We go faster
C :  To go for
C :  To go faster
A :  Oh
B :  Hmm that's interesting idea
B :  But if you press for a long time we do something that's there
B :  So if you have your ten buttons for the uh
B :  For the new maybe then you made about those and you have to have in this one the more you
B :  You have a few percent for a long time
B :  No but more
A :  Maybe we should have also uh did you
B :  No we should have a complete wide and i've got some comments
A :  Button
A :  That that that
A :  Yeah
B :  "'kay" standard way
A :  Yeah
A :  Maybe we are four so to have that it's all increment there
A :  I dunno big because if you have the
B :  But if you select if you if you want to turn it into it out for example
B :  Then you have you got a couple of this number in the implement that
A :  Yeah because you have your previous channel button
A :  Sure increment that only it's not uh doesn't was that
C :  Yeah
A :  Because the previous change your your minus one
A :  All press one
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  So i think we need also digits
C :  Okay
A :  Maybe we we can make it
