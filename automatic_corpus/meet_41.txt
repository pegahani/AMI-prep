B :  Okay right
B :  And l.
A :  Do you think
A :  Yes
B :  Yeah
B :  Okay
B :  Right
B :  Um well as the kick-off meeting for our our project
B :  And um
B :  This is what we're gonna be doing as an extra five minutes
B :  Um so of course we'll just a kind of
B :  Make sure that we all know each other i'm ryan and the project manager
D :  Okay
B :  Two and to introduce yourself to get
A :  Hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be industrial designer
B :  Okay
D :  And i'm andrew and i'm the marketing
C :  Hmm
D :  Experts
C :  And create an an easy interface
B :  Great okay
B :  I know
B :  And sir designing a new remote control
B :  And um
B :  I'll have to record easier actually
B :  So that's
B :  Do that and encourages know
B :  And you all right on time
B :  Um yes it is a design a new remote control um as you can see this this be original trendy and user-friendly
B :  Um
B :  So that's kind of or or brief
B :  So why
B :  Um
B :  And so there are three different stages to the design
B :  And i'm laurie sure what would you guys have already received
B :  Um
B :  In your emails what did you get
A :  Um i just got the project announcement uh uh designing a remote control
B :  Uh-huh
A :  And it's
D :  Yeah that's that's
B :  Is that what everybody calls okay
A :  You think
B :  Um
B :  So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it
B :  And
B :  Repeat that process three times
B :  Um
B :  And at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there
B :  I have
B :  So uh that
B :  You get to draw your favourite animal and

A :  Oh cool
B :  Is that away on
A :  Yeah yeah
B :  I
A :  Um
A :  Well like
A :  I don't know it's just first i might need off the top of my head um it's bigger even this "'cause" i'm allergic to most animals but you channel four so um issues inaccurate right
B :  Oh
A :  Oh oh um yeah and i kinda like wheels becoming know i
A :  You'd everything in sight i
A :  They're quite harmless and my role than interesting
D :  Right
D :  Hmm
B :  Okay
B :  I saw the note of interaction that
B :  Um
A :  Mm
D :  Superb stage kind of uh
A :  I
A :  Tales bit bigger
B :  I actually is a dog as well
B :  But
B :  I just a different kind of dog
D :  Yeah
B :  On my favourite animal is my own though look at home
A :  Mm
B :  Um
B :  That doesn't really look like um actually
A :  I
A :  Oh
B :  Yeah it's more like a pig actually
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Well
A :  Yeah
D :  I see a dog in there
B :  There are the three good idea
D :  No seriously
C :  I
B :  Ah
D :  What kind is it
B :  I give the next year old uh uh uh various things
B :  Um it
B :  And what they like about that um
B :  That's this to suggest that his tail wags
B :  And it's very friendly interior and orestes to see um
B :  Right kind of affectionate and
B :  Um
B :  Uh
B :  And it's quite quite we as well so you know you can doesn't take up too much space
B :  Um
B :  And uh
A :  Oh
B :  Eh does of anything which is the tail
A :  Yeah
B :  As well this is quite music say
D :  Is you where the this is on to it really see thing
A :  Mm
A :  Mm
B :  I couldn't see it as i she's had a standard
B :  And um it just all this and this get up and start chasing its tail
A :  Oh
A :  I
B :  It's round living room
A :  And after that
B :  Yeah so uh
D :  Probably when use little he got lots of attention for doing it in
B :  Yeah maybe
D :  Has forever been conditioned
B :  Maybe i
B :  And um where she found this just an here
B :  Okay
B :  Yeah
B :  Meeting next
B :  Um
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Okay um and i need to discuss the project finance
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
B :  So current a brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro
B :  Um i'm where
B :  Aiming to make
B :  Fifty million euro
B :  Um so we're gonna be selling this um an international scale
B :  And uh we do want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros saying
B :  Fifty percent of the selling price
D :  And we discover that again
B :  Sure
D :  Um so this
D :  Ah right yeah
D :  So cost like
D :  Production cost is
B :  All see the other
D :  Twelve fifty the selling price is is a wholesaler reach yeah
D :  Like on the shelf
B :  I i
B :  But uh i mighta
B :  That's good question
D :  Our sale our selling or
B :  I imagine it probably is are sell actually because it's probably up to
D :  Okay
B :  The um
B :  The retailer to yeah some of whatever price they want
B :  Um
B :  But i i don't know i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on
B :  Hi redesign it at all
D :  Yes
B :  Okay well
B :  Um
B :  Mm
D :  All right away i'm wondering if there is um and like the d. v. d. players if they are zones
B :  Oh yeah regions and stuff yeah
D :  Um
D :  Frequencies or something
B :  Yeah
D :  Hmm
B :  Okay
D :  As well as um
D :  Characters um different uh
D :  Keypad styles and simple
B :  Yeah well for a remote control think that would be
D :  Uh mm
B :  I suppose depends on how complicated a remote control is
D :  You know
A :  It does make sense mm
A :  It is i think it's
A :  Yeah
A :  More complicated for your can languages and you need buttons
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  Okay
D :  And then at it and then all of the other thing international is on top of the price
D :  I'm thinking
D :  The price might
D :  Might appeal to a certain market in one region where is in another it would be different so
B :  Or just like in terms of like the wealth of the country like
D :  Just a characteristic characteristic uh huh
D :  Just
B :  How much money people have to spend on things that
D :  Or just like
D :  Basic product that is positioning
D :  Twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london
D :  Might not be such a big hit in and
D :  Grease and uh
B :  Yeah it's it's them yeah
D :  Something like that
A :  Uh-huh
B :  Marketing
B :  Get more control over it should be writing on this time
B :  Um
D :  Right away and making some kind of assumptions about what
D :  What information we're getting here
B :  Mm
D :  Thinking
D :  "'kay" trendy probably means something
D :  Other than just basic
B :  Yeah
D :  Something other than just
D :  Standard
D :  And
D :  So um
D :  Wondering right away is selling twenty five years is that so that that that is gonna be like the premium product
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah yeah like how much does you know remote control cost
B :  Well twenty five euro mean that um
B :  That's quite like
B :  Eighteen pounds or something isn't are know as as as much as well
D :  Yeah
B :  Sixteen seventeen eighteen times
D :  Yeah it's it's yeah
B :  Um
B :  As in i've never bought a remote controls are you
D :  No
B :  Hi how good a remote control that we've got you
B :  Um
D :  I am
B :  But yes is it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
B :  Right
B :  Okay
B :  We just go on ahead here
B :  Okay
B :  Uh well that does anybody have anything to add to
B :  Uhuh
B :  To the finance issue at all
D :  Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
B :  No actually that would be useful though it may if you knew like
D :  Other mm
D :  Yeah
B :  What your money look at you
B :  Nine
B :  Mm
D :  Here interesting thing about discussing the um
D :  Production remote control for me is that
D :  But as you point out as don't think remote controls being summoned something people
D :  Consciously
D :  Assess in the purchasing habits
B :  Yeah yes
D :  It's just like
D :  Getting shoelaces issues or something this comes from
B :  Five minutes and the meeting oh okay river behind
D :  Tony like
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  Is it is or like how do you i i mean one one way look at a be well
D :  The people producing
D :  Television set maybe they have to buy
D :  Remote control
D :  Another way is maybe people had t. v. set a really set up with their remote control
D :  And they really want
C :  And um
D :  A better one or something
C :  Okay in time but i'm more controls because um the fed up of having four five different calls for each thing starts
D :  Right
D :  Right
C :  So um and then was just it's how many choices control
D :  Okay so
D :  Right so in function wanna priorities might be
B :  Yeah
D :  Two
D :  Combine as many
D :  Uses
B :  That's a design that should be like a main design a name of a remote control do you know
D :  I think so yeah
B :  Your your satellite ten year
D :  Yeah
B :  Regular tally in your v. c. r. and everything
D :  Like to um
D :  Maybe what we could use as a sort of like uh example of a successful
D :  At least technology is
D :  Palm palm pilots
D :  They're drawn from being just like little sort of scribble boards to the cameras m. p. three players cell phones
B :  Hmm
D :  Everything agenda so like i wonder if we might add something you do that
D :  To the remote control market such as the lighting in your hair so are
B :  Yeah
D :  Um
B :  Or even a in a in a it's a ball it's
B :  Um what you wanna watch slightly my pen they're all i want one sentence estimate and that's a good idea
D :  Yeah yeah
D :  And
B :  So a extra functionalities
D :  Yeah but personally for me at home i've i've combined be um the audio video might television set in my d. v. d. player m. s. c. d. player
D :  So they will work actually function together but i differ remote controls for each yeah
B :  Uh-huh is
D :  So is sort of ironic that that then they're in there
D :  Um
D :  You know the sound everything is just one system
D :  But each one's got it on the know
B :  Hmm
D :  Right
B :  Um
B :  Okay uh at all uh gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly a nice couple of minutes
B :  And i'll just write nothing else
B :  Okay um
B :  So anything else anybody wants uh at it but what they don't like about remote controls and use what they do
B :  Would really like to be
B :  Part of this new one at all
A :  And you using them
B :  You keep using them at a
A :  Find some here okay uh-huh
D :  Mm
D :  Hmm
A :  I mean that's really quite small or when you why
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Yeah i think uh
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  And you
D :  Yeah
B :  You get a response we can if you like whistle or make really high pitched noisy beep
D :  This is really yeah
D :  Yeah
B :  But i mean is that something we don't include you think
D :  Huh
B :  Hmm
D :  Sure
B :  Okay maybe
D :  And i remember when the first remote control might
D :  My family had was on a cable actually cable between get the t. v. in big like
D :  Buttons as sort of like
D :  Like on a blind or something
B :  My goodness
D :  And um you know anything about what they are now
D :  Better but actually it's still kind of
D :  I don't know like
D :  And massive junkie thing on the table
B :  Stuff is quite primitive
D :  Maybe we could think about how
D :  Could be more you know streamline
B :  Maybe like a touch screen or something
D :  Something like that yeah or whatever be technologically reasonable
B :  Okay
B :  Uh-huh okay well i guess that's up to our industrial designer
D :  "'cause" it could be it could it could be that if it could be the functionally that doesn't make any better but that just t. p. all of
B :  Yeah that's better
D :  I've not having you know these days is a rip
D :  Using that he was phones are becoming more and more like
D :  Sheik you know
B :  Yeah
D :  Um nicer material than
B :  Okay
D :  Might be
B :  Okay
D :  Be worth exploring yeah
B :  Right well and so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes so that's point um about ten to twelve by my watch
B :  And so
B :  In between nine and
B :  Um
B :  As the industrial designer you're gonna be working on
B :  You know that's a working design of that so you you know you doing there
B :  Um
B :  For our user interface
B :  Technical functions i guess that's you know like what we've been talking about what i'll actually day
B :  And and
B :  Uh marketing executive
B :  You'll be
B :  Thinking about what it actually what you know what requirements it has to
B :  Has to fulfil
B :  And you will get instructions email t. i guess
D :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  Okay
B :  Yes it's at the functional design stages next i guess
B :  And uh
B :  And that's the end of the meeting
B :  So i got that little message a lock same as my thought i would say
D :  Um
D :  Before we wrap up just to make your own same page yeah
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Um
D :  Do we
D :  We're given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something right
B :  Nine yeah
D :  Well
D :  Um
D :  Are we i mean right now nice function uh a television remote control may have features which could be on the television
D :  Or are we keeping sort of like uh
D :  And design commitment to
D :  Television feature
B :  Okay well just very quickly "'cause" we're supposed to finish my and i guess that's not to us i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of that
D :  I don't know
D :  Okay
B :  So um
B :  You know
A :  I don't want that it would be production cost
D :  Okay yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Because there's a cat there so um
D :  Okay
A :  Depends on how much you can cram into that price
B :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
B :  Yeah
A :  I think that's the main
D :  Okay
B :  Okay
B :  Right okay well that's that's the end of the meeting them
B :  Um
B :  Uh
D :  I am
B :  Thank you all for coming
A :  Yeah
