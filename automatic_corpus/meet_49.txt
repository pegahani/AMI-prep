B :  And we've got twenty five minutes to do that
B :  Far as i can understand
B :  No it we are talking a remote control which prepared you know
B :  Um we want it to be original
B :  Something that's it
B :  People haven't thought of it's not in the shops
B :  Um trendy
B :  Doing to wise market but
B :  You know
B :  Honk of math or
B :  And user-friendly granny's t. k. it's
B :  Maybe that which is should be able to use it
B :  Okay
B :  Um first is the functional design um this is where we'll go off and your individual work
B :  Um
B :  What needs need to be fulfilled by the product
B :  Um what fact the product have to have
B :  And how it's actually going to do that
B :  And conceptual design
B :  What we're thinking how it's gonna go
B :  And then the detailed design how we're actually gonna put into practice make it work
B :  Okay
B :  Right so we're gonna practice it depends
B :  And draw our favourite animal
B :  On the whiteboard out there for us
B :  And um so what's the characteristics of that animal

C :  Okay
D :  Okay
D :  Uh
D :  Again this is off the top of my head i was gonna do a big cat too
C :  Um

D :  Uh
C :  Ah
D :  It's not a vampire but honestly i

D :  You can tell it's uh flying i don't know i don't have to go i never thought of if we go
A :  Uh
D :  Any goal and i can i'm thinking i might be good enough
D :  I suppose they're also independent i put that one done again
D :  I don't

C :  We get a golf
D :  End up and independent right you set of golf
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  You do
D :  Oh oh right okay i'm not "'cause" it called
C :  An ego
B :  Yeah
D :  I think the quite three spare set
D :  Flying around everywhere
D :  Doing there and think
D :  And uh
D :  Birds of prey on a boat here
B :  Uh-huh
D :  In trap it out and try it
B :  Uh-huh
D :  There we go
B :  That's something
D :  And that pens gonna be okay
D :  What
B :  Okay
B :  That was fun
B :  Right
B :  I'm fine that's why it's we've got a selling price of twenty-five euros
B :  Which you don't actually know what
B :  That is sometimes at all
B :  Any ideas
C :  It's about
D :  Seventeen
C :  Mm yeah
A :  One point four and uh
A :  One point four euro would make of all something like that
C :  Yeah yeah so you are so that
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah that's seventeen seventeen pounds or
B :  Fifteen seventeen
D :  Seventeen times
B :  Okay
B :  And so
D :  Should we be making this is the speech into should first place a comma
B :  I think so i think that we have to um put up or to put in the shared folder or something
D :  Yeah okay
D :  Okay
C :  Have it
C :  Having said that they did you wanna get one though is
C :  The the ones on the market mind missed that about twenty pounds anyway
C :  So i had to be yeah
D :  Right
B :  Yeah
C :  We have to buy one
B :  Mm
D :  So i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price or or is it going to make our product look at e. p. c. d. option
B :  Yeah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Um production cost of twelve fifty
B :  So
A :  Okay but if you might yeah
B :  Half
B :  Of the selling price is taken up by building yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
B :  And profit aim is fifty million euros
B :  Which is uh
D :  Interface here
B :  You yes um yeah
B :  Machines are
D :  Uh-huh
A :  So and
B :  Um
D :  You got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be at um accessible and usable bicycle all age groups just did
B :  Uh-huh
D :  They're not focusing on this this market any particular think it's everyone user friendly to one okay
B :  No yeah
D :  Big target group i
B :  Yes yes i don't think we have to i i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that
D :  Yeah
B :  Um making a key point
B :  Just it's going to be an international market like
D :  Mm
B :  Stray the american things like that
B :  Okay
B :  What are your experiences with remote controls
B :  I mean i've got we've got um
B :  We have three feet here's a t. v. and that sort of um saying all set up
C :  Yeah
B :  So we don't want a universal remote controls
D :  Right
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
B :  Um do you program each of you things and t.
B :  But that kept losing the signals so we'd have to reprogram never then again i think it's quite cheaply as well
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  So that might have some stupid but that was quite good the fact that you could
C :  You still the ones the same time
B :  I didn't have six remote control sit in front of you
D :  Right
A :  "'kay" you wanna integrate everything into one like
C :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Okay
C :  "'cause" see
D :  My experience is only being being given the remote control with the object type by not doing any tampering with an programming using it to programme t. v. you're out of ideas and things
D :  But basically on off volume up and down and channel one to use that basic function and i think i could go any further with it
B :  Hmm
D :  And that so
D :  So that it should be something useful but someone like me as well
B :  Yeah the main that's the main stuff anyway i mean
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Can you do want to i hate
B :  I hate looking at it control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words thing what the l. d. a. and just
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah
B :  Sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that
D :  Mm
D :  And symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols and then to understand it yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Simplification so we'll see
B :  Um
B :  When there
B :  When you got the main things on the front of it and a section it opens up or something
B :  To that
B :  Other functions when you can't use and or options kind of
D :  Uh yeah
B :  Recording things like that inside it
D :  Uh-huh
B :  "'cause" it doesn't make when you pick up it does make it big complicated to look at
D :  Uh-huh
B :  All be guess what you're doing
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Um
D :  Actually i just reasons the point i want to work design people think
D :  But you know on a mobile phone
D :  You can press a key in a gives you a menu it's got a menu display a wonderful incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you've got a little l. c. d. display
A :  Menu right
C :  Yeah
A :  Right i was thinking on the same lines you
A :  Is it are having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user
A :  Yeah maybe have an l. c. d. display or something like that like the whole point
D :  Within a nice
A :  And that menus
D :  Yeah
A :  And if it's somewhat similar to what you have a mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and maybe get also
D :  Yeah
B :  Well that the older generation of like raining go and that's
B :  Um
A :  You mean to say that
A :  Mm that's a number
B :  Like that i can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't
C :  Yeah
B :  Even dream of text thing or something like that
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Can he programme this remote control is the basic with that too
A :  Right
B :  I don't think the tapes things
C :  Yeah
D :  Right
B :  Okay thank you use
C :  My kind a touch of them may using teletext a
D :  Right
D :  So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with
C :  Yeah
D :  That's gonna be a problem any means the older generation or not
B :  Yeah
B :  Right yeah
D :  And that's another is you have to call that
C :  Yeah
C :  Why just needs to be as a as a source self intuitive and you can
C :  Can work out
C :  One of these things turning "'cause" i mean menus
C :  On
C :  So for me
C :  Science it now that "'til" call these pages and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you turn it a
B :  Mm
B :  Tonight
C :  But then i how
B :  I don't like say you know the new phones that kind of a windows based
C :  Oh yeah
B :  Running system
D :  Uh-huh
B :  I find it be easy to if you saying i kept getting lost in the friday i have not can you want to um our friend going you want less fancy things for the
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And it just kept getting lost but
B :  That's just me
C :  Yeah i don't i don't know you how of uh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Twenty bottle at twelve euros fifty how much uh
C :  Excellent screen if you get you'd you'd have to so do you go down to um
B :  Yeah
D :  Uh-huh
C :  But from what l. c. d. thing you wanna see
D :  Is it possible that but for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press the large pretty light you could watch a box
D :  But is it displays last on the screen
B :  Teletext other options well
D :  It displays less on the screen but as long as they can be good that's the main thing
B :  Yeah
B :  Or ball playing
B :  Kind of a chill
B :  Function and that's
B :  You've got the basic buttons just for you to a volume programme
B :  Things
D :  Uh-huh
B :  And also and then a menu to go into
B :  With all these pictures of these samples and
D :  Yeah
B :  That's where you control recording and things like that
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Mm the other thing is just to talking into mobile phone design features again
D :  "'cause" of laptop remote control for the when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the
B :  Uh-huh
A :  "'kay"
D :  The flip over
B :  I think that's a cost thing again
C :  You
A :  It might
D :  Yeah
B :  I don't know how much we're gonna know about it
A :  It might save a bit of space at it and sort of in bulk it might look small
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes yeah that's important
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
A :  But it might have it's cost implications
D :  The smaller
B :  Okay
D :  And there's no reason we need to make it look a as fashionable and stylish is a mobile phone i can still be like we plastic
B :  Mm
D :  You know
D :  Something that's easily mould it and
D :  Geez
B :  Yeah
D :  Sorry okay so then you terrace you guys i
C :  No uh
B :  I
B :  I am right okay we've got half an hour the for the next meeting so we're gonna go off and your individual things
B :  Um
B :  I think that's probably about it
B :  And then we'll come back an eight again
C :  Yeah
B :  And i can't stand out there
B :  Fantastic powerpoint presentation
C :  Just
C :  Just uh uh quite thing about the um
B :  Sure
C :  But what you're saying probably it doesn't doesn't need to be fashionable be so why i have a quick look at the company website and it's like the
C :  The uh we put the fashion into electronics so i think
D :  Oh right
A :  Okay
B :  Okay
C :  I think the top design thing what they caught
D :  Okay
D :  Sure
C :  I mean you don't you
D :  Yeah
C :  You can still have plastic and it look
C :  Quite good but
D :  Yeah i mean it doesn't have to be that in it but that was my main point we do have to use them as a lot of use plastic does make it cheaper to see that would yeah
C :  Yeah
B :  Hmm
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  I put "'em"
B :  Okay
B :  I mean this guy remote control something that kind of mold it and
B :  Look a bit different and the telly with remote controls to settle for plastic
D :  Right
B :  That's that's hard to
B :  So yeah yeah i can say stuff i think uh-huh
D :  "'kay"
B :  Okay
B :  So
B :  That's breaking up there
B :  Okay
C :  Okay
B :  Uh see in half an hour
D :  Do we get back to that
B :  I think so
A :  Yeah
