C :  Um it may it's from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you
C :  How have our
C :  Um there are some changes that i've got from on high fact
D :  Okay
C :  And
C :  Are there to add
C :  Well well what and actually the eyes was that the uh
C :  This is for a specific television
D :  Okay
C :  So all the all in one idea "'cause" i dunno hand that they require us that's
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Very hard to look at that and uh let's see it's
C :  Play number four
C :  Um okay we've got to and then we can see what we can adapt from it
C :  So what um presentations we
C :  Anybody got
C :  We're going to go
C :  Randy oh okay
C :  It's tough
C :  Uh-huh need to plug yeah yeah
B :  So
C :  Uh-huh just uh
D :  Wow
D :  I
A :  It's uh
A :  Inspired design
D :  Yeah
B :  Do you think or
C :  Scroll wheel uh-huh
C :  And that's what the lines so
C :  Hmm
C :  Mm hmm
B :  After that
C :  It was function f. eight
B :  F. a.
B :  Mm
C :  That should be blue one uh huh
B :  C. d. f. k.
C :  No
C :  She did okay
B :  Uh
B :  Me and in that is the marketing expert
B :  Uh as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out
C :  Although i'm sorry
B :  Yeah sure
C :  It and if you just click that'll go ahead with that
B :  Yeah actually something i have to see that as well
C :  Oh sorry
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah thank you
C :  Hmm
B :  Yeah
B :  Yes i have to look or are they uh market potential for this product
B :  And make
B :  Can do more like kings and everything what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve this a net profit or our aims or not
B :  Then
C :  Press f. five to start
B :  Yeah i can
C :  Jesus
B :  Um
B :  Then
B :  Uh uh the methodology a doctor to find out of this it was market survey
B :  A uh detailed market survey on consumers was bound to find out that like incentives like kings what the press forward in or breath or what problems they do encounter in all this type of things
B :  And work for a good first
B :  You find that
B :  It's yeah
B :  Uh a word there that would problems they're having with the current uh remote control so available in the market
B :  Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control so whatever in the market are are really they're not so we're looking so we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this vector also like
B :  Our design uh should be appropriate should be good looking
B :  For the consumers
B :  And yes that's the that's the that's really
B :  This can definitely a pretty uh uh in the house or a sales
B :  Uh
B :  And even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay a high uh pay more for this a good-looking remote control so so so even if they ever in a market "'cause" so it'd be available i even in the market "'cause" for the available remote control is
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Less
B :  Even then we can sell it at twenty five euros which maybe which may seem quite high but
B :  If i would look so if they do a remote control we design have ago better a better broke read their designs then we can hope that consumers and that for this the remote controls
B :  Then
B :  It's yeah
B :  And it's
B :  And the second thing
B :  Some some companies that thing that they show them what are more functions of the users
B :  Uh well in their remote controls but rather than those having more functions in their remote controls we should emphasise
B :  But actually can do more hard for the operate better than making it too complicated because mostly because they found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons so there is no fun of having ninety percent but that's making the remote control still but we do too complicated too expensive
B :  Yeah
B :  But i think i believe that technologies use it only if
B :  The the consumers they want to use it either way there's no fun of having all this table think so this way to not only way to do the cost of all of remote controls but then again please uh what profit also so we have to take care of this vector also
B :  And
B :  It was function i want to go
C :  Well you're the back just escape
B :  Yes
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Then if we look at this
B :  Slide
C :  Oh yeah
B :  Um these are your shared documents you can see
B :  Right
B :  Uhuh
D :  So i
B :  So
D :  Sorry i was just gonna say what was the question for us as be coming and uh
B :  Our look or the market ancient art of uh well how we should design can do other remote controls what they should be there so as to in a in a house of uh the profit in have solar cells
D :  So these percentages up
B :  Yeah these are different days ago parses
D :  Uh well
B :  Like
B :  Um sorry yeah i can all on that and i'm sorry
C :  Speech recognition
B :  Yes
B :  If we look at the course whether the consumers they're willing
C :  Mm mm
B :  So
B :  For the pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not
B :  We can find that they
B :  After a thirty five years is a joke we have a very good disliking for this uh this for a blind like for speech recognition in a remote control so we can emphasise on this point also like
B :  Because it would have really in a house or say that in this
B :  A. d. in this part or age group from uh fifteen to thirty five and i i i then i think that most of the users of data more a t. v. at belong to this age group
B :  So
C :  Where else well we're looking at everybody's as well
B :  We should look at
B :  Yeah we can look at does that factor also
B :  So yes or
C :  Uh-huh which i think twenty five to thirty five is uh
C :  Usual sort of
D :  Mm mm
B :  Yeah
B :  So
B :  And
C :  "'s"
B :  And and
B :  Yes
B :  Okay so
C :  Mm
B :  Uh it will look at this that um well how uh how well what are the problems of the balloon was that fits in with the existing remote controls in the market
B :  They find that that that that the five percent to thirty four percent of the country where they find too difficult to operate a remote control
B :  So it should be in such a way that
B :  It should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide
B :  Well uh spend uh a problem and no suffice to use also so as that they would go there was could easily lead then you know to have any must technical know let's do see at the mall how to operate these remote controls so this is also a bit of a maybe a factor to load take into consideration when i was a profit senses
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So
C :  Uh
B :  This is a lot
B :  Uh a market potential but i mean
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Yes
C :  Okay thank you
B :  Okay
C :  Um headphone with helen yeah
D :  Yeah sure that's cool
D :  Um
B :  Yeah we have to
C :  Ah so we do
B :  It it it has
D :  Yeah
C :  Fun and games
C :  That's the cables can be long uh huh
B :  Yeah okay
C :  I think it's kicked off or whatever
C :  Once upon that means
B :  And this one has to
C :  Oh okay
D :  I can't and my computer quickly that's okay
B :  Thank you very much right
B :  Definitely
D :  Um mm
B :  Yeah
C :  Hmm mm
C :  Yes
D :  Okay and then what i press f. eight
B :  Yeah i think function f. eight
C :  Function f. eight
D :  Alright
D :  Okay cool
B :  Smartkom function f. eight okay
D :  Um
D :  Yeah basic know
D :  Ah
C :  Uh-huh
B :  Come from
C :  Yeah yeah
B :  Computer adjusting yeah
D :  Okay
D :  Okay and then have like press the the pick one
D :  To get on to the big
C :  Uh if i
D :  F. five and i press i can to get all
D :  As well to uh
C :  And f. five inescapably a bike and just the and left button for
B :  Escape
C :  Advancing
D :  Okay so um i need interface design designer
D :  User interface designer sorry uh i'm concerned way of
D :  Um
D :  What effect be a greater should have on the user
D :  And um
D :  I am
D :  I will say
D :  A one to point out there
D :  Ah ma said
D :  Put the fashion in electronics so it's like
C :  Hmm
D :  We as the company we want to make a product trendy in fashions a big concern about this
D :  Okay and had a person just the next button
C :  Yeah just the life there
D :  Yeah right
D :  Okay
C :  Life okay
D :  So um i take the existing designs and also um the information to rise cases was very useful but what people like what people dislike
D :  Um and
D :  What people
D :  Fashionable because we said
D :  People between twenty five and thirty five where the main
C :  Uh-huh
D :  And by is of
D :  Of our t. v. i think
D :  So it um what they like
D :  And what define fashionable
D :  And economics research
D :  Um i dunno i haven't actually been else do any of this myself but um maybe that comes up and in it
C :  Can come on the rubber as well
D :  Um the findings well
D :  The basics that was a basic function
D :  Send messages to the television set that so people want d.
D :  Um
D :  So we need to be included
D :  Um but i've got some pictures here some leading ones
D :  I don't have to get them to press f. five is that what
C :  Uh if you if you escape then you can see your power
D :  Escape
D :  Uh okay cool
D :  And what classes once i hit this one
C :  Yeah
D :  The user to leaving um
D :  Remote control to the mail and
D :  You know they grey days i mean this one's got loads of buttons it's hard to tell from here
D :  What they're actually do
D :  And they really very exciting at all um
D :  Personally i prefer this one just because it's and it's easy to use it's a bit more sleek with them all
D :  Of the silver stuff
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Um but they "'kay" that's what we're against and i think we can do much past that
C :  Hmm
A :  Yes
D :  Um
C :  I hope so
D :  Hang on
D :  F. five
D :  Okay sorry
D :  Personal preferences um
D :  Well i think we need to i think the economics it's quite
D :  And important
D :  Um
C :  Take three or four
C :  Yeah there was a bit and that is but i resign things as well
D :  Uh huh
D :  And um i thought not too edgy and like a box more kind of hand-held more um
D :  Not as uh computer ian
C :  Organic
D :  All organic get more organic shape i think
D :  Um simple device like the last one we just so not too many buttons and as much point out
D :  Only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons so i think what we
D :  Can you miss out on the buttons we can make up for in
C :  Sales
D :  Design and
D :  And how nice it fixed
D :  Um
D :  Hand held and course but i think a sportsman it's important because t. f. t. of just
D :  Um
D :  Released
D :  Um i think is it
D :  At a remote control for presentations so uh and a big seven inch big screen anyway
C :  Yeah it's like a yeah
D :  So um
C :  It would be good
D :  Yeah not so doesn't have a prayer
C :  So do i
D :  Um it anyway um
D :  So your hand held portable and uh
C :  Right
D :  Oh i thought about the functions for t. v. but as you pointed out people don't actually want that say maybe we can do that
C :  And it's also the company want to keep its talk to the t. v. for uh to keep then the production time
D :  It's a one t. v. i. right okay so
D :  And uh so it last thing i thought which i could you mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick
C :  Uh-huh
D :  To set us apart from other people like learned are
B :  Exactly yeah
D :  Um which it does already it's exist it's not a very
C :  Yeah
D :  Why actually use i don't think
D :  Easy find a with uh a whistle functional something over chargeable stay send because it's a pain when you are not batteries
C :  Okay
C :  Yeah
D :  And
D :  I think that yep that's it
C :  It's cool
A :  So um
D :  Okay
A :  I know as we talk about speech recognition
A :  And whistling
D :  Uh-huh
A :  And uh
A :  I'm just curious no
A :  I would any research and how many people can whistle
C :  I
D :  Yeah
A :  If it is that a function we want in the remote
D :  Um i you have an be able to
C :  Um
C :  To have trouble was like
A :  I don't but i i know a lot of people do it
C :  Really
A :  Yeah just i mean as be a certain kind whistle to right
D :  Uh-huh yeah or some sort of voice
C :  Yeah i suppose that's true well as well you could you you could have that you could have the basically and instead it was all if it's got a voice recognition you could have it just
C :  You know where are you
D :  Yeah
C :  And uh
A :  That's costly there are much easier thing is just any about noise like clapping um
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  Shouting you know
C :  That's good
A :  And then what the response p. it beeps back at you or something
D :  Yeah something
A :  Okay
A :  Well
A :  Uh i set this up
A :  So plug it in press f. five
A :  Function f. five
C :  Function f. eight for the um
A :  Oh function f. eight
C :  Yeah
D :  I needed
D :  It would of the thing you've got a thing
A :  I think it's it's just a lot in in
A :  It's got it
D :  Okay
A :  Um
A :  So as the industrial designer
A :  My job is
A :  To take an input
A :  From you guys
A :  Um so it's good you want first
A :  And i jotted down some notes as to what it needs
C :  Remember
A :  And uh what kind a novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others
A :  Um sir i just told us that
A :  Uh
A :  Consumers are want to
A :  Spend more for fancy practice
A :  And um
A :  You also mentioned that
A :  Uh
A :  The current products don't always match users operating behaviour
A :  Um by the buttons are used
A :  And
A :  Uh
A :  You mention that are not fun to use
A :  And uh a novel feature which uh which is brought up with this
A :  This automatic speech recognition feature or
C :  Uh-huh
A :  Noise
A :  Detection future
A :  For when you lose your remote like people microphone on it
A :  And any noise over certain threshold
A :  Um i'll pick up as a
A :  A distress signal on
C :  Uh-huh
A :  From you and i'll be back and say you know your hand
A :  Or something or this or
C :  Sure sure that would have to be
C :  Um
C :  So specific rather than above a threshold "'cause" if you had a like a movie on your likely get it
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Oh yeah
C :  Beeping back at you
D :  Mm
A :  That's true or maybe you could have uh
A :  Um
A :  Uh-huh that that would be a consideration taken care yes
A :  Um
C :  Right and interim yeah
A :  Yeah well that that's uh for later down the road
C :  Hmm
A :  Um and then as for the user interface it should be trendy
A :  Um
A :  And that computer e. right so more low-tech
A :  And not too many buttons
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Set appeal on to consideration
A :  And also i have some limitations from the boss
C :  Hmm
A :  Um
A :  And
A :  Practical annotations which i kind of threw out the window
C :  Hmm
A :  And side it will research and on for some me all i had
A :  To work on with r. r.
A :  Our corporate archives of the great product it maybe for which include
D :  Uh-huh
A :  You know um spacecraft
A :  Coffee makers and board trains
C :  As uh well that is
A :  Or i speed train
C :  Hmm
A :  Right and having personally worked with all these products
A :  Uh i have a great deal of experience with the
D :  Yeah
C :  On a scale if it if you can build spacecraft you'll have no problem of the remote control yeah
A :  Industrial designer these
D :  Yeah
A :  So
A :  I figured
A :  Just put "'em" all together
C :  I
A :  You had a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport
D :  Uh-huh
A :  To your t. v.
A :  And um
C :  I
A :  As for the user interface problem
A :  You know too many buttons do the one button
C :  I i
D :  I
A :  And it's uh
A :  You know
D :  I
A :  For the the cowboy analysed just
A :  I'm not quite sure what the the function is there
C :  Right okay uh huh
D :  Well i like that design
A :  It's a good i mean you could have a
D :  Yeah
A :  You know
C :  As that this which is on the speech recognition is entirely speech operate it
A :  So i think i i missed the budget thing as fifty million euros
C :  Uh-huh
D :  If if if
C :  Yeah
A :  And we are assault twenty five of them
D :  Yeah not a problem
B :  Fifty million dollars a rough
A :  Okay
C :  And that's the first in mind euros we've got a uh uh
B :  As a profit
C :  With
A :  Oh okay so i i miss those numbers
C :  Gotta make a profit so when i can add twelve and a half
A :  Okay
C :  Euros of time
A :  Well i guess more realistically them
A :  We need a product that's got some kind an f. t. outer casing cheap plastic uh
A :  You know um
D :  Uh-huh
A :  It should be just like
A :  Uh ten to the price maybe or less
A :  An energy source which pride just be uh your regular batteries
C :  Okay
A :  Um we wanna have it
C :  Would it be possible to have a rechargeable idea was that
C :  Is that gonna mark up a lot
A :  Um
D :  Well little base station or something
C :  Yeah
A :  Yeah yeah we could do that too
A :  Um and thought of that
D :  That might cost more like as opposed to with batteries
D :  We don't need to provide all we pride fast batteries bit
C :  Yeah yeah
D :  It's more it's that's cheaper
A :  Right
C :  I mean if you think about this base station so essentially just a a lead to have a
D :  To justify battery
C :  Self connecting break in it so
D :  A battery and uh huh
A :  That's the
C :  I don't think i'd go up up the price that much
D :  Okay
A :  So it
A :  The years the user interface uh
D :  Okay
A :  The canonical user interface for this to be just a bunch of buttons
A :  But since we're cutting edge company
C :  Yeah
A :  We uh of course live
A :  Alternatives like
A :  Uh speech recognition
A :  With some recognition and rocket power
C :  Okay i
A :  We had our product
A :  Um and i see the transmission interface is uh
A :  Just an engineering thing i regret that
C :  Yeah
A :  Um so years you know great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me
A :  Um as can see that
A :  The remote control have parts and the sports
A :  Look like that and
A :  Um
A :  You know it's got uh
A :  Operating procedure that looks something like that
A :  And
A :  I suppose you a know how it works "'cause" we've all used to
A :  And we want in a company designing remote controls if we cannot they were so
A :  Uh personal preferences
A :  I think
A :  Um programmable options
A :  Which um just requires more not a memory
A :  Uh not have a little memory just
A :  Um so the user can put in their favourite channels and
D :  Mm
A :  Maybe they prefer to find settings that wanna turn on and start blasting
D :  Mm that's a good there's uh like the programmable options
B :  Yeah me too
A :  Okay
A :  And the uh
A :  The bells and whistles that we mention you know it take more budgeting um more technical
A :  Uh expenditure of effort
A :  And it's also much more likely to not work
C :  Right
D :  Okay
A :  If we had its bells and whistles
A :  So i like that
C :  Okay thank you much um will take that back
C :  Yeah
A :  Will stay
C :  Right also so um
C :  And also got not very long before the meeting so
C :  That must forward on t. v. a. is to find it so
C :  Uh huh
C :  Yeah
A :  I think it's good and
C :  Yeah
C :  Mm
C :  We had that it's
C :  And to it
C :  This include teletext
C :  Um because it's become outdated everybody uses the internet anyway
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Um the oracle would have to say that the remote
C :  Um it's only for the television which i'm presuming means is for specific television
D :  Okay
C :  And then instead of colours and
C :  Sort of colour options
C :  They want corporate colour and slogan some higher implemented the new design
D :  Corporate colour
C :  Yeah well i i i
D :  Okay
A :  Yeah the
C :  I presume um
C :  Everything all the sort of uh
C :  You know the the corporate website and everything's yellow
D :  Uh-huh
C :  And the logo and uh so the slogan we put fashion fashion in electronics
C :  Um
C :  I don't know exactly how um
C :  Sort of incorporate i mean
C :  I guess if you go for a sort of
C :  Popular shape because kind of working its way around it or something
D :  Yeah
C :  Um where am i
D :  Okay
C :  Yeah
C :  Okay so we have to decide need on which functions are going to actually have
C :  Uhuh
C :  Yeah
C :  We had as listed options we hand
C :  Speech recognition potentially flat screen
C :  Interface l. c. d. interface
C :  Um
C :  We also
C :  Want to limit the number buttons so that much take that one is right we use the basic functions for a television
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  No
C :  Teletext
C :  Yeah so
D :  All the the the danger that is
D :  It could look at it cheap
C :  No no buttons you mean
D :  Yeah
C :  So so strike a balance between uh a few in the
D :  Well
D :  Mm
C :  Well it's like we just cutting on the um
D :  A number buttons kind of functions of the
C :  Oh i do have ever have us from over my head
D :  Uh-huh okay
C :  That they don't want don't think so
D :  Okay cool
C :  And i'll be right you can find that
C :  What people would think about that or not because and
C :  Some information about that about it and what people
B :  About cost
C :  Other people would require
C :  Um teletext
C :  In a remote teletext option remote control
B :  Okay
C :  Text
C :  Mm
C :  Okay
C :  So uh it a take it your position alloys that
C :  The bells and whistles we gotta come up with a
C :  A gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Um
C :  So
C :  I mean that uh that the sort of encoding i'm getting from little bits of um
C :  What channel and being sent is that they're quite interested in uh t. f. t. display
C :  Interactive display
C :  However that does send a bit like the
C :  More complicated design that rough
C :  A seven inch um
C :  So people to like
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
C :  Although i guess if the so the sort of
C :  Think about standard interface is the people use already sort of windows style
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Dropdown menus or whatever i think maybe that's a bit
D :  Yeah
C :  Go that far but
C :  You know like in a basic sense that you could have
C :  Your basic selection buttons and if you hit that sort of menu the top you have
C :  Um
C :  Because the different selection buttons so so keep the simple
D :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  And um
C :  Paul in the dark is that
C :  Sort of with a light inside that or a set itself
D :  Um
C :  On that are material
D :  A plane that are material i was thinking
C :  Okay
C :  So
D :  Um so i guess that would be cheaper than that by "'kay"
B :  Ah
B :  Amazing something want it
B :  Uh it's a thing is really really very important point yeah
B :  Is it if we look at the market
B :  Those people most of teams and people they find that the remote control cell phone or somewhere in the remote
B :  In the home
B :  But
D :  Often lost was that yeah
B :  Yeah and loss and means therefore that they they have kept in remote control last time where do we add speech recognition as well as the glow in the dark and board is factors will have the locating the remote control
C :  Lost yeah
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Like if they come and speak something of the remote control
B :  Uh it applies to something something and it glows in the dark about this sectors of all these points will help them to locate
B :  And they they they have kept this remote control and this are definitely in the house or less
D :  Mm hmm
D :  Uh-huh
B :  Well market sense
B :  So we should
B :  Take it into consideration also
C :  Okay cool um
C :  Speech recognition i take it
A :  Oh it's
C :  I don't have the north know products
C :  Uh um
A :  They're actually there was the was the remote control they cannot to use go they had a uh some basic speech recognition on it
C :  But you speech recognition whale
A :  You could program it with your channels and then you so you know like uh
A :  B. b. c. one and it goes to that channel
A :  Yeah it did work for a while though because of this noise reference problem they mentioned you know if the television says you're losing two b. b. c. one
D :  Mm
C :  Yeah already uh not uh i never for b. b. c. too and b. b. c. one or switch the channel for any kind of thing
D :  All
A :  Right right and so there's lot of this should be watching the t. v. and then also made it pick up the noise and turn off or in our kind of i'm up or something
C :  Uh-huh
D :  Uh-huh
A :  But if you can work around that that noise problem
C :  Yeah
D :  Well what about this might get big too expensive actually but
D :  What about um
D :  Something was bill since the t. v.
D :  Um that and you can press and i'll send out a little signals you know like the ones that week on here
D :  Or or something
C :  Uh that's a good idea
D :  Um that and that will activate the remote control starts
D :  To be
C :  So like uh kind of backwards remote
D :  If you five
C :  From that
A :  Right and then or do you just you know uh subtracting
D :  Yeah
A :  Kind of cancellation of the noise we could do then would be you have uh
A :  Remote control by the t. v. speaker
A :  And i'm uh i'm sorry microphone by the t. v. speaker and transmitter there
A :  It sends back to remote "'cause" you can't
A :  Um expect the the television manufacturers to
D :  Mm
A :  To put that feature into their t. v.s
D :  Yeah that's the only thing yeah
A :  But yeah then you have like to also a separate module by the t. v. speaker
C :  Which just icon yeah
D :  That comes with our remote control yeah
A :  Right and then the remote control know
A :  Um what's been produced by the television
C :  That's it
C :  Sort of basic alright
C :  Kind of
A :  Right right
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Frequency so i'll be cheap
A :  Right right um
A :  Yeah that's certainly possible and and another thing is that this losing the remote in trying to find it again
A :  If you do have a sorta speech interface to it you only need to find it
A :  You just say you know on whatever you whatever you want the remote for you know to change the channel
A :  Or or to turn the t. v. on and off
A :  You just shout your command to it you know do it for you
A :  If it's within you know what i'm hearing range
C :  Uh-huh
A :  And i you know could be someone there i mean we have no idea where it is and it's still a bootstrap
D :  That could also be built since the t. v. there which might make a remote control of the obsolete
C :  Yeah
A :  Or all three were
C :  What do is a good job
A :  Or ahead of the curve
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
D :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  Okay
C :  Oh
C :  Uh they like the whole
C :  Sort of
C :  Remote feedback thing
C :  Um
C :  So i think rather than
C :  And i also kind of
C :  Take set the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very well and things like that
D :  Mm
D :  An expense
C :  So i should be an expense in the time so i think
C :  If we're going to go well i mean like the thing about the that's the problem of the t. f. t. or the l. c. d. kind of thing is
C :  Uh if you're also wanting to
C :  It kind of
C :  A organic
C :  Well be sort of
C :  Feeling to it then
C :  You may have trouble incorporate the screen
D :  Hmm
C :  Um
C :  But i guess not with um uh just just pretend that's not a problem
C :  Um
C :  Uh uh huh and how are you but the corner dark materials are
A :  Um
D :  Maybe a user or because we said um colours and fashion were important so maybe
D :  Um just like little
D :  Line this kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
C :  Contrast control uh huh
A :  Yeah i know the the materials cheap
A :  But it's just uh
A :  The the go on the dark your needs some like a charger and you know and then uh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah okay
A :  If you're if you're sitting in the dark for too long or it won't go anymore
C :  So if a step is to it yeah
C :  Or if it's done under the couch cushions and it's really fine line
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Right
C :  Um this is
C :  Okay well we can use we can still use a blue dark as a gimmick essentially and
D :  Yeah "'cause" what i thought maybe
C :  If we're gonna have to go for gonna have the logo on as well bright yellow logo an hour
C :  Or um
C :  Slogan
D :  It's like an yeah
C :  Uhuh
C :  Then you know they're gonna be fairly bright colour anyway
C :  And you can have sort of uh
D :  Right
C :  Uh training as well of the corner don't feel just as gimmicky nice
D :  Uh-huh
D :  "'cause" you had out more than finding it that was more like in a few watching a fill in the dark
C :  Uh-huh
D :  You can um
D :  Still see the remote control
C :  Alright so on
D :  That was more of a uh a gimmick
C :  F. f. f. or f. gonna go with the idea of
C :  Um
C :  And uh feedback
C :  So of remote finder then
C :  That kinda
C :  Stuff that one of them
C :  You think
D :  Mm
C :  And makes it really unnecessary that
D :  Yeah and uh so yeah
C :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  Okay so scratched yeah
C :  Um so we've got its do we want to go with a t. f. t. idea of the
A :  Um there are getting a lot of features now
C :  Is that far too expensive
C :  Yeah
A :  I think
C :  Oh i mean i think i think this or find the finer things
C :  I mean it's uh
C :  Could probably make a circuit diagram flat percent
A :  Yeah
C :  Um
A :  Well i think uh consideration too is that these other remotes gonna be used to like make it run around
D :  Mm
A :  It's a good chance to the t. f. t. screen would break or or get damaged
C :  Uh-huh
A :  They're pretty fragile
D :  So is that what about definite requirements that they will that we need to to to scroll
C :  Okay
C :  And no i mean i was i was going on rafts there i just sort of
C :  Um
C :  Marketing
C :  Research i guess um
C :  And
C :  So stick that's sort of program ability and
C :  For the buttons that we do have
C :  And
C :  So that's sort of
C :  Included in your sort module kind of stuff
C :  Um
C :  A a a you're finding out by that
C :  Teletext
C :  We could find out there
C :  Mm
B :  And the text to speech recognition
B :  She
C :  Um i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition is uh
B :  Yes
C :  They have uh
C :  Um expensive
D :  Yeah i think so
C :  No
A :  Oh no it's it's much cheaper the t. f. t. it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits
C :  Alright okay
C :  Is it not the circuits the cost
A :  And it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like uh
C :  Alright okay
C :  Uh like it takes back the r. f. i.
D :  Okay
C :  The r. f. remote sort of ideas uh huh
C :  Um
C :  Five minutes
C :  Okay
C :  Decisions
C :  Yeah four it's good for who wants to have tea
C :  No one because i thought that i was speech recognition yeah
B :  Yeah
D :  Mm that's cool
A :  Okay
C :  Um
C :  Speak recognition limited buttons organic design
D :  Um
C :  And what else is a thinking of um and then and then for for that my program about three
B :  The number in dark
C :  Um
D :  It's not too expensive i think it can it
C :  Okay and also integrating the rabbit integrate the logo and the slogan
D :  Mm
C :  Okay so
C :  Um can you put all these reports in the project
C :  Documents folder if that already in there as well so it just tells me
B :  Yeah
A :  Yeah yeah
C :  Summarise um
B :  Yeah
C :  And um
C :  Operate oh i'm i'm doing anything to do in there anyway so uh
D :  And where is it sorry
C :  Up for uh project documents
C :  On
A :  It's it should be when you save
C :  Yeah my scenario controller
A :  I mean test so to say that it's
D :  So mm
B :  Uh-huh is it in shared documents
A :  And then uh that'll folder up and
C :  Um uh
A :  Again
B :  Composer object to
C :  Project documents yeah it's on your desktop as well
A :  Again
A :  All over the top
A :  It's
A :  That stuff
A :  And then
A :  Project documents
D :  Okay cool
B :  Hmm
B :  It does not giving anything
C :  Yeah
B :  It wants
C :  And i love to uh is it going strings of um information or try and forward any
C :  Specific anybody in particular
C :  It seems to get in there rather than
C :  Respect to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting and then we turn up so
D :  Okay
A :  Kijke my email
C :  Okay i i i
A :  It's making sure
C :  Mm mm mm
C :  Mm mm
D :  Okay
C :  So
D :  Well i thought was up uh the material is um
D :  Maybe not this kind of a tail maybe more
D :  Like um this kind of work for a materials to bit more
D :  Now see like you said they get trapped around a lot
D :  Um
D :  A bit more durable
D :  And that can also be uh economic and it kinda feels a bit
C :  Yeah
D :  Different from a lot of remote controls
D :  The rubber round
C :  More sort of um
C :  Place like the plasticky sort of
D :  Uh-huh uh-huh
A :  Wow
B :  Um but we have to take care late
C :  This isn't it
B :  But do we have to take care of it would zero so if they means
B :  If to the guys are real relief did you it you shouldn't be too long phone so whatever material we use
C :  Oh no ethics that's gonna cost us money
B :  You should be yeah
D :  I
B :  So um
C :  "'kay"
B :  Yeah true safety point of view also we have a t. k.
C :  Safety
D :  Oh i think we it
D :  With the more organic
D :  The shape of it wouldn't be as bright as have many sharp corners of that so that's something
D :  Good um
D :  Hi jane uh i mean
A :  We could go welcome
C :  Smac smells good for channel
D :  Yeah yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  We are completely are the box and make this thing
A :  A big red ball from ball
C :  I
A :  And it's got that thing and inside
A :  And there's no buttons at all it's always on and just yell at it
D :  That's a good idea
C :  That sense
D :  I i should have a
A :  And to tell the all of that
C :  Yeah i was gonna have to do is gonna be a
C :  Ideal
A :  Or yellow yellow all right
C :  Form well yeah alright
D :  Yeah it did
D :  With the colour that um doesn't have to be all yeah they
D :  Do you know
C :  Please got no um
D :  Mm
C :  Well i wouldn't i mean why
C :  Reaction turn all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than or or so i think just having it
D :  Yeah
B :  Small logo
D :  Having the the uh
C :  So rent in a global
B :  With the l. a. is more yellow strip only yeah those games
D :  Okay
D :  Mm mm
B :  In the logo in it
D :  Uh-huh
D :  Okay
D :  Cool
C :  I'll see if we can argue with the boss about bin
C :  Is that we
C :  We put fashion in to
C :  Okay
C :  Couple we've got wrong with the fashion in electronics
D :  Oh yeah it's a good one uh
D :  Yeah
C :  About that okay it somewhere
C :  Okay any last
C :  Where is queries
A :  Twelve thirty
C :  Okay
C :  So i so i
