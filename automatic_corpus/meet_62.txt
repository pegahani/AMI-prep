C :  Mm
C :  Mm
A :  Mm
D :  R. i. k.
B :  Uh-huh
C :  Mm
B :  Oh
B :  Mm
D :  My stuff up
A :  I forgot that on a with a lot of these oh
A :  As i say like madonna with one of these on
B :  I
D :  High school would that's a nice things like
C :  Mm
D :  What was what one of these already have uh
C :  Hmm
C :  Mm
D :  With a plan for
D :  I
C :  Mm
C :  Oh
D :  Uh
D :  Oh
D :  Uh-huh
C :  Yeah
A :  I've heard about it
C :  Oh
A :  Back again and all that wonderful meeting
B :  No
D :  Yeah
A :  It's uh
A :  Everyone ready
C :  Yeah
D :  Yeah or
B :  Almost
A :  Okay but if you hold on a minute
D :  Uh what cost
D :  Oh from the moth
A :  I think it with this band thing if you come play it to in in
D :  I i
C :  As a kind of spam and everybody likes to see
D :  Two
A :  Uh you are uh
A :  Okay but not technically or whatever
D :  Hmm hmm hmm
A :  Um
A :  I first uh for just uh we get from well
A :  Last meeting
A :  Yeah
A :  It was we got together to see basically decide on
A :  Well to talk about what it is
D :  I am
A :  But we were actually uh supposed to be doing in
A :  We we all well and
A :  Stuff like that
A :  Mm
A :  At the moment is kind of what's going on
A :  Um what we're gonna talk that in this meeting
A :  Is um
A :  Yeah we know what it is it with their in their we know that is that
A :  T. v. remote and stuff and
A :  You guys are just be enough this um
A :  Some uh r. and d. for that
A :  That's research and development
D :  Uh-huh
A :  Right and that that before
A :  The noses need to those terms of this right
A :  Um
A :  Yeah you uh
A :  Three though presentations
A :  Whether they be on computer or
A :  On the white board or
A :  Whatever you want
C :  You have any preference uh of order
A :  Um
D :  Mm
A :  I'd like to um
A :  Yeah
A :  Or i'd like to hear this is on the um
A :  From from uh
A :  Catherine actually first or would like to hear about
A :  Uh is uh
A :  If we finally decided on um
A :  Well so then she were gonna be using and
C :  I think she's to finishing yeah
B :  No no it's fine i'm just
A :  It's just a yeah this is tiffany first
B :  Okay
B :  Where is that
D :  It's yeah
B :  Oh sorry and see
D :  Um i
B :  Would that work
A :  Okay so from position
A :  I
B :  Okay so that's again
B :  Um so what um
B :  For the energy sources we can have an a basic battery uh a hand dynamo which is which was use uh in the fifties for torches if you're over that channel
B :  Wouldn't be that
A :  I don't think any this room in the fifties
B :  Wouldn't give
C :  It's like a crank thing i said uh
B :  Yeah yeah wouldn't be very fancy you can have a kinetic
B :  Provision of energy which is used on some watches these days so if you have just a bit of ten to movement that it won't give it the energy to work
D :  Mm
B :  All you can new solar cells well i'm not sure about buying do was really but
C :  But there's sometimes combinations i mean the calculators too combinations of
B :  Yeah
C :  Battery with
C :  But also using some solar power
A :  Don't know these hopes solar panel things so that's where from the sound or can they were from a light bulb
B :  I don't know actually
A :  Does anybody know
C :  Um i think it has to be only only solar energy but i don't know
B :  I know
B :  Um
B :  Thank them very uh
A :  Okay
B :  Or cost or less would be
B :  The basic batch really
D :  Mm
B :  And uh
B :  If we want something fancy i think the kinetic provision of energy
B :  Could be nice for
B :  I dunno if it's worth the cost
B :  So we've got to discuss about
A :  Hmm
A :  Okay
A :  So we can see
B :  For the case of the remote itself and they can be a general case which is just a flat one
B :  You can have a a curved one or double curved one
B :  If you know what i mean so
A :  One double curved one
B :  You know kind of more way gonna make that kind of sits that paul the hands like kind of thing
A :  Okay
B :  Um
B :  But then the case material itself so it can be uh
B :  Uh it it or plastic
B :  Or
B :  Uh latex
B :  Uh or rubber wood or titanium and
B :  Mm for each of them you have the cases where
B :  For example titanium you call use it fold if you if we choosing a double curved case we can choose titanium
B :  And if we choosing a um
B :  Solar cells then we can choose latex for the case material so we just have to take that into account
B :  But if we choosing just the flat case then we can go for it thing
B :  Um so i think we discussed earlier on the or
B :  Yes oh i problem things so we could uh
A :  Ah okay well i did this in the rubber
B :  Yeah
A :  But then that's a you know
C :  Uh squeezable remote
A :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
B :  And also it doesn't break as easily maybe i dunno
A :  And to buy the t. v. programmes got one navy of watching imagine that we obtain just lost again "'cause" it costs very little panels off the wall okay
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah i live there
D :  Uh-huh
B :  So rubber would be
B :  Okay
D :  I think rabbits
A :  Rubber uh we'll we'll go we'll like that idea you think you can market that
D :  Well after my after my fast and
D :  I think i think he'll realise the rubber small
A :  Or we live rubber cool
B :  Us
D :  People
B :  So which
B :  Okay
B :  And and the other pushbuttons so you can have basic push buttons or scroll wheels like to have on a mouse
B :  Um or you could have uh um
B :  L. c. d.
B :  Which gives you a display
B :  Um scroll buttons as well
A :  Uh-huh
B :  So if you use a rabbit double curved case you must use rubber push buttons
B :  So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case
B :  Um and if we choose double curve then we have to go for rubber push buttons
B :  So it's a constraint
A :  Well we gonna go we were working with the sorry there's gonna be a rubber case so
B :  Yeah but is it the double curved one or not
B :  If it's not double curve then we've got the choice for the pushbuttons if it's a double curved we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
B :  It's um it's
A :  Oh push buttons instead of the wheel
C :  If it's rubber as an indelible anyways i mean it doesn't matter if it's double i mean isn't a a rubber case mean it's completely
C :  Fact i mean it it fax just whatever they want
C :  Yeah yeah
C :  This was the difference between a normal rubber case um rubble double double rubber double curved
A :  We've got a form of all double double i
B :  No but
C :  Yes
B :  Now that
B :  You see in the okay the energy that's one thing
A :  Other big mac place
B :  Then you have the case is uh whether it's flat a curved
B :  And that's we don't care if it's from rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material
B :  So if
B :  We've chosen role rubber and if now we have the choice for the case where there it's flat single curved or double curved
B :  I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go uh i don't know why but we need to go for uh rubber push buttons
C :  Okay
B :  So
B :  Either
B :  I dunno we just need to decide on the
A :  Let's have rubber push buttons i
B :  On the case
C :  Cool rubber
C :  The rubber the whole way
B :  As go crazy
B :  And then to have a last slide yeah side a
B :  Um so the pushbuttons and sell it can be just simple they can be so that's just the electronics between that that behind the pushbuttons
A :  Yeah
B :  Um and the price but there was it with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest
B :  Uh if we get a scroll-wheel that's a higher price range if we get an at times chip
B :  Which is um used for the l. c. d.
B :  The display thing then that's even more expensive
A :  Yeah
A :  Mm
A :  Chip on print
A :  Well we have infrared uh
A :  Okay all of them not understanding yeah
B :  Hmm
A :  Is that okay advanced chip-on-print
A :  Which uh pretty was that one
A :  We see
A :  And that's got all the electronics uh one board including
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  The um
B :  The infrared
A :  Infrared sender
B :  Yeah
A :  But um
A :  What ought
A :  What alternatives do we have to that
A :  He um
A :  What alternatives do we have to the chip on print
B :  Well if if it's not chip on print and i guess you get defend chip components
B :  And you build them separately and doesn't include infrared
B :  It's less expensive than
A :  Mm so it has
B :  Technically speaking it's know as advanced but that's a job to
A :  So why would we
A :  Not go for that
A :  If it's um it's inside the the unit
B :  It doesn't yeah yeah yeah
A :  It doesn't affect whether the customers gonna buy it or not
B :  Totally
B :  Yeah
A :  Um
B :  So let's not go for the
A :  We wanna go for uh and it it all as long as it works
B :  Yeah yeah
A :  You know
B :  I agree
A :  So let's not let's send a follow with it on print
B :  So it's either um
B :  The scroll-wheel all the pushbuttons
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah pushbuttons
D :  What about that just to know the sample sensor
C :  I think pushbuttons is
A :  What about what
D :  The
D :  The sample sensor sample speaker
B :  Well
A :  Well in the speaker for the remote control unit
D :  Oh no
D :  Because
B :  It they it be cool but they saying that just developed it i'm just guessing but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably in
D :  Channel two
C :  Yeah
C :  The the the be
C :  Speech recognition um
C :  Option is that it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh
A :  Yeah
C :  "'cause" uh-huh
A :  It's not so we we wanna go into with this product
C :  The yeah the example that they are they using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can programme
C :  A sample that um
C :  But when you say something or whatever responding you program the response as well as just unclips the the the you record yourself
C :  So you can programme a coffee maker that when you say good morning to it says
C :  Hello red or another
A :  Yeah
C :  But i mean it's not
A :  I
C :  It would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t. v. um like turn the t. v. on and it turns on but it's not that it's just "'cause" you have
D :  Oh it disk is a non so
C :  Change gives you a verbal response so yeah i mean
D :  Oh then
C :  But what's the point of saying yellow remote i mean uh will help for her yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
D :  I thought i thought it was when they said
B :  Just if you really lonely maybe
C :  Yeah really well maybe it is it
D :  I thought one i said voice recognition them and um
D :  Like
B :  Channel five
D :  Channel five and a chance like to talk to it can i have ten of power i have
B :  And then switched on
C :  No no no doubt that would be more promising
A :  Yeah
C :  It's just a remote that talks to yeah yeah
D :  All that forget about it are okay
A :  Yeah
C :  And it's certain cues
A :  Yeah
B :  Okay so i'll go back maybe to see the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should cheese so for the energy source to be go for the battery all day
C :  Yeah i'm fine with the basic battery
A :  Basic battery
A :  Just shape cheerful it's worked
A :  Doesn't work
B :  Cheaper option uh you have you that
D :  Yeah
B :  Okay
B :  So we go for that rainy
B :  Then the case do you want it to facts or curved or single or double curved
A :  We we got we would uh with the latex but the the r. s. i. e. probably
C :  Yeah so we wanna rubber rubber
C :  Double curved
A :  That would be uh uh
D :  So look like something like this
B :  Double
A :  The double well probably is
B :  Okay so then
B :  If we use
B :  Double curved case then we have to you she used rubber push buttons that's fine
A :  But um for the simple buttons
C :  So rubber rubber keys yeah
A :  Yeah
A :  And it's cheap it's still round
A :  It sounds kind of funky
A :  And we can also market it as it "'cause" we're is it stand out you sign or here in your research and um
D :  Oh you have
A :  They do have they are they would and they complained of our so i
A :  And this is anti r. s. i.
D :  Yeah
B :  Yeah
A :  So that's another of marketing point or we can use
D :  Well the rubber push button so
D :  Do you have to move your
A :  But anything's gonna have buttons
D :  Mm
A :  Even if it's a joke will it still repetitive
B :  I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or
A :  You see still get you tell you still get repetitive strain injury when you're pressing a button or pressing a flat the screen
B :  But i don't know
A :  It's the it's the fact that you press the same doing the same movement
B :  Yeah
A :  It's not actually what you're doing
A :  But the fact that this this rubber it is actually used be nice
A :  Anti r. s. i. e.
A :  To specific
D :  The other rubber's good
C :  We're giving them a way to burn off steam basically
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah so they can sit there and like
C :  Not that watching t. v. should be that stressful
A :  And you know yeah you can for the across the room
D :  No ah
C :  Yeah
A :  And try to thirty children
C :  I yeah i guess t. v. can be stressful if you're watching sports
A :  Yeah
B :  Alright that's me done
C :  Alright
A :  Okay gabriel there's some
C :  Right
A :  Yes that's a free about the um it's the interface
C :  Yeah some uh what i have to say it ties into
C :  Like adam was just talking about
A :  Right
B :  Sorry
C :  Okay in some continuing with the user interface
C :  Uh topic
C :  Yeah so basically i had consulted with our manufacturing division sunday like captain was also speaking with them
C :  Uh
C :  I also to irises marketing findings from the last meeting and to consideration
C :  Um "'cause" i think that's
C :  It's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going going to include what buttons we're going to include in another laid out
C :  Uh yeah so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of
C :  Of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products
C :  Yeah like the coffee machine
C :  So i already mentioned uh speech recognition interface i guess we we basically you know that idea
C :  It's it's pointless
A :  Hmm
C :  Um
C :  It's just a sample sensor sample output
C :  I just be probably the most expensive part of a remote without any actual interesting functionality
C :  As far as operating the t. v.
C :  Uh so yeah they they also get the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on that
D :  Hmm
C :  Side of an m. p. three player like ipod
A :  Mm
C :  Um so we've already address that
C :  I think that would actually be worse for something like r. s. i. i mean you get that some of my data constantly going
A :  Yeah
D :  Mm
D :  Okay nine
C :  Um
C :  The other suggestion
C :  And i i have a feeling that
C :  Were interested in and something more general but they suggested uh
C :  You know going a little bit into it and it should like you are doing a remote put skates we can do that
C :  A lot of colours
C :  Um the keys might be you know funny or or play phone some way
A :  Uh-huh
C :  Or uh something for the elderly where the remote very large and the buttons are very large there's only few buttons
C :  But
C :  Yeah we can we can discuss this but it's not like from our last meeting we really wanna something that was general but but um well uh so i mean
A :  Yeah
C :  Um
C :  So picky layout and design a really crucial you don't want uh you want people to build a quickly access the buttons that they use lot without uh was pressing along one
C :  Um
C :  Yeah and i didn't mention we need a power button or or a last i can give you an example here of uh
C :  Yeah good way and that layout
C :  Uh
B :  Hmm
C :  From are
C :  Manufacturing department so this would be an example of bad
C :  Yeah where you have volume up and volume down but they have a v. on both of them so uh
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  It's sort of
C :  Confusing for the user
C :  Uh
A :  Do we have an a number of a good one
C :  This is an example of the giant remote that's impossible
C :  To lose
A :  Oh yeah i have
B :  I
A :  For it in there
D :  Well
C :  And for something for kids
C :  Yeah
C :  Um
A :  Yeah
C :  Yeah so
C :  Yeah and i think my personal preferences of
C :  We've all kind of talked about and seem to be on the same page um
C :  Uh so was against the speech recognition and against
C :  Going uh it was in your thing and
C :  And then each sense i think it should be more general
C :  And i don't think the spinning wheel with the uh l. c. display or
C :  Or crucial for us
C :  Yeah and yeah
C :  That's it for me
A :  Okay well let's say um
A :  So what waterford decisions on this end
A :  As saying
A :  The um
A :  The um the interface type with them for
C :  So we're we're gonna have any sort of display i think uh
A :  So is the same was
C :  So yeah it's just gonna be
A :  So go straight set of buttons
C :  Just me pushbuttons um
C :  I think we should have a limited number
C :  Of buttons ideally i mean it like power channel up channel down volume up volume down the numerical keep that
A :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  Uh
C :  And uh some sort of you will have a lot a lot but my connection or or a cover or something like that
A :  Yeah
C :  I guess that's the point where we need to decide about that
A :  Okay and without yeah
A :  When
C :  One other we decide are
A :  Oh we get out of work and uh we did we decided um when do
D :  Yeah
A :  We're gonna supplement it with anything you know colours so
A :  Secure
A :  Gimmicky bits to we're not we're just gonna go for something
C :  Um
C :  It seems that we would wanna make it too busy and to sort of
D :  Mm maybe we can
C :  Daddy but
C :  Um
C :  Yeah that's a mean maybe a couple of colours like uh
C :  Like a black with
C :  With yellow line somewhere like maybe the r. r. can be yellow uh
A :  Yeah
C :  Something like that
A :  Yeah okay
A :  But the docking
A :  Yeah i dunno really questions on this
A :  Let's move on to
C :  I i guess the the fact uh also that we are
C :  Having a rubber case
C :  Uh
C :  Well prevent us from having that cover
C :  Functional we thought of before i mean "'cause" that's so if we wanna have a lot of some sort of have to be a button
A :  Yeah sure
A :  Yeah that yeah
C :  But i think that should be i mean
C :  Um
C :  I can speak with the button department that uh i think that should be easy to have a button it just prevents prevents the other
A :  Yeah the button that this does that yeah
C :  The other buttons from operating
C :  So it should be simple
A :  Cool
D :  Right
D :  Well i'm just basically let me know what's happening in be
D :  Mark it it's
A :  Yeah
D :  And what fast as a for next year
D :  Um
D :  So yes
D :  So from looking at this this this trends and fashions
A :  Uh-huh
D :  And also a recent investigation that we've done in remote control market
D :  We have found that for a remote control market
D :  These are like most important aspects that we really need to which we've already probably discussed
D :  Um
D :  The most important aspect is look and feel so that what contrast the look-and-feel fancier than the ones that already
D :  The we already have
D :  So it has to be
A :  Yeah why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that kind of that serious
D :  Exactly
D :  Um seconds
D :  Uh it should be technologically innovative innovative
D :  So
A :  Does that mean
D :  Uh-huh technologically it should be like
D :  Um
D :  Work
D :  Yeah i guess
D :  It should work
C :  We should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced and what's on the market
D :  That's nice
A :  Okay now it probably is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that work's already this cheap
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah
C :  X. m. in this first two points we've already sort of gone away from "'cause"
D :  Yeah
A :  Yeah
C :  I rubber one is not fancy and it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy
C :  If that's what people want then we here we go in the right direction and it's
C :  It's not technologically innovative either
D :  Uh
A :  Or wavy we cared so um
D :  No wood
D :  That's why thinking bluetooth "'cause" it's flat put a blue to use them as a a bluetooth remote control and it's got like a
D :  Because bluetooth is the in thing nowadays
D :  Like really think
D :  Like people
D :  And um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for the don't really care whether
D :  You know
D :  The end of the day whether it works properly or not
A :  Course a two
D :  Well it there but it's flat it's not
A :  Ah well i suppose and i still first thing you go oh i wanna buy that gotta love it works or not
D :  Yeah but it looks good if it looks good and it sickens the speed of decoration
A :  Uh okay well
A :  But you to think about this
C :  So is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
D :  Well eh
C :  Electronics
A :  Yeah what i've done so well
D :  You could always and so yeah
C :  That's basically what allows you to do it
A :  Yeah and then this is just
A :  Gonna keep all this is being used for is your television
D :  Yeah but
D :  I mean
D :  People like
A :  It would be that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it
A :  Which not no television does does it
D :  Well if you're looking at
B :  Well
D :  You see looking at
D :  Something that's going to bolt by people you have to make it nice you have to make it
A :  That would mean we have to make a television as well
D :  State of the art
B :  But if wood for example and apply i think see um
B :  Um
B :  Connect for example you if you get a call on your mobile phone but you more mobile phone is downstairs is something you would get on this solution you been called by this person right now
B :  Things like that
A :  No that would be a telephone thinking them in your television
C :  Yeah that that would be the remote so much i mean
B :  Not
A :  Yeah
B :  No but if you get bluetooth on the remote should be
A :  Any
B :  Able to
A :  And uh to tell of it
B :  You would the television you want
A :  The television would have to be a play to use compatible
B :  I was just trying to find an advantage
A :  Basically
B :  Well what what what advantage would you get for the
D :  Well it doesn't
A :  At and there is not there is no such thing
D :  Like it doesn't have to be
D :  You know bluetooth that was just an idea but like it needs to something that's
D :  You know is new
D :  Whether it's a battery it could be something really
D :  Really my know
D :  You know like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there
D :  And people already seen it
D :  People already got it
A :  Okay
D :  If we want something new we need to move away from what we already have
D :  And um
B :  Maybe the kinetic will provision of energy than
D :  Just go creative
B :  It's been done for watches of a problem see and that for remote yet
A :  Okay yeah that's that's that's very good
D :  And then you can market it never have to change the battery again that
B :  Change the batteries ever again
A :  And this and this is all time you buy nicely
D :  Um
A :  The fact that is why that uh this rubber
A :  We're concerned about
A :  Do we should think uh with people so they remote controls about because it charges itself out what they're in it
B :  Well i
C :  Yeah so can
B :  And then little characters you say yeah but not too much
D :  I think safety
A :  But yeah but this place in it they
C :  Yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
A :  That's a great idea
A :  Well done
D :  Third most important aspect
D :  Um it is it's easy to use and i think we've all um
C :  Or all about that
D :  What does that that's um okay in a fashion at supposed to look text it's fast and a very much in
D :  So and vegetables
D :  Of them are like they have theme for cloths shoes and furniture
D :  So next eight people would be park if i
D :  I found if if i think i think in a scroll be shaped yeah it's
C :  Okay so we can have keys there like a like a broccoli key in the
D :  And things
A :  Yeah
D :  Yeah
C :  Uh another colour
D :  Rubber i think
A :  Ah what's find out what channel
C :  Okay uh-huh
D :  Um
D :  And as as well but the feel
D :  Which is in
D :  We see a spongy so it's
C :  That's right
D :  It's not quite spongy spongy i would say this
A :  Well spongy that's why we got that's where where where i had a big and uh
C :  Yeah that's great for us
D :  So where the
D :  Yeah
D :  And so i press of what i'm saying like to move away from the current
D :  Remote controls that like the look-and-feel of the car ones and
D :  Change the look and feel whole still keeping the company's image
D :  It's like
D :  Yeah
A :  Okay
D :  As well
D :  Had to say

D :  I think
D :  If it's rubber
D :  It needs to be

D :  Think about here
D :  Um like
D :  I'm just thinking bright colours
C :  Yeah
D :  Bright natural colours nothing
D :  Two
A :  Bright but not too bright
D :  Right but seen that yeah
D :  Like you know lime green or bright yellow or bright pink or make it different colours so that anybody can see like

D :  Have
D :  The logo
A :  Okay
A :  What's easy
B :  Yeah

D :  You know lots of people wanting something
D :  Really funky cool
D :  Like
D :  And kids will be walking in with their pets a
D :  Or

A :  Yeah
D :  And
D :  Yeah the only thing is is a really small kids much on it
D :  But
A :  Well it's it's gotta be to prove yeah

D :  Yeah
A :  For different so we could do that the pink line is the blue line is the green lines that
B :  That's yeah
D :  So like you walk in a like a like a remote control because the brand then
D :  And in the shops is that comes out as as well what colour would you like it and make a look at it is cut off
D :  Well that that's
D :  I think given the customer into more control over what the boring instead of you call colours on the on off
D :  So they also get to pick
D :  Well pressing a like walk into a shop too cynical
C :  I mean that that seems to work well what products like ipod where you know you have a variety of colours that people feel like the customising it wanna buy it you know
