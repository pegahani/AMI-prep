to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we are here for the concept design meeting .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We'll then t take decision in concert
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : The push button are usually extremely cheap ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Um , what is the purpose of the light ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't think that this is really expensive ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : To have the light always on ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , a little bit .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , because it's robust .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : But that's not in the trend . .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we can keep the wheel

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So we will just use a a standard battery ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .
