to --> C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay . So first , let's uh see the prototype .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we have speech recognition .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
D : Oh , these are strawberries .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Material , we want to stick to titanium .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : For the L_C_D_ .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : wh what are the strawberries for ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's location sensors .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is .

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : what do you think , is it fancy ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
D : So here , two . Up .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Then we have uh technology .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : d I think it's a one for that , at least .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Robustness , uh-huh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It's um robust , yeah .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : we only address two main functions here
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , two .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So size and weight .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Up to three for that ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Colour and shape .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : The case is silver titanium , no ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And what about the strawberries on the top ?

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Inform
C : We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .
to --> A,D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I suggested three .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh the last one is adaptive .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay . Let's go for one .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now we have to do the average .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Two point one seven .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : We need only one battery .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have sample chip .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Titanium .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : How many push-button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
D : Two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The scroll-wheel , okay .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : One L_C_D_ displayed .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we are at seventeen dot eight .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : So think of what we can cut uh here .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : to make electricity .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We we win one .

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So , put minus one there , please .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess

D : I think white-board is useful .
to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : Digital pens , useful .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser .

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
A : I'm not convince .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .

to --> D,C,B
