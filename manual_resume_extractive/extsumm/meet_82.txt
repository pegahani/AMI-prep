to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um they've got lots of buttons on them
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that uh people don't use

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and people lose them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'll just be talking about the components design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then this is translated uh into uh light signals
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which are then seen by the T_V_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and this creates a a connection within the the remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the chip then senses this connection
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and produces a signal in a Morse code format .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This signal's sent to the transistor

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then sends it on to the light emitting diode

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which is then trai changed into a infrared light

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Also we have to work within the company constraints ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um , however that's gonna cost more ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Do we do we know uh by how much ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't actually have any price information ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a lot longer than an off the shelf chip .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we need to make a a decision here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : given that the um the technology is not well developed
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and and given that it's it's never been done before ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it will have voice recognition um uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so I did some research on the internet

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um commands and mechanisms for the operation ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and there're just kind of a variety of choices .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um findings ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : a lot of times they tend to look cluttered
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There're some special ones available , like this one right here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is marketed towards children , um different designs ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : just kind of minimise the clutter ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : avoid too many buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think they're they're about the same cost really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there's a lot of slide buttons out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : Okay , fair enough , fine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : So three three there's three buttons on a slider .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like the shape of it almost like a mouse ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we have to come up with is the the actual shape

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I was thinking kind of just for the volume ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : this is my report on trend watching .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh the most important aspect is the l the look
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it has to look fancy , look and feel
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh instead of the current functional look and feel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and the third being easy to use is probably a given ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : clothes , shoes and furniture
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : that's different , certainly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But fashions do don't last very long .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Also means you can drop it without damaging it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's like the old Swatch watch
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : What if we included the batteries in the cover ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Oh yeah . I like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like they have for mobile phones
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the fashions apply to furniture ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : yellow seems a bit of a strong colour

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so that you can just sort of ho hold it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you'd want it narrower than a mouse though
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you want something you can definitely grip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and then it widens up top

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we need the the manual controls

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But the television would be the display

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like you hit menu
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and menu will come up on television

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Kate and Kendra now go away
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Our energy source is gonna be

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And interchangeable case ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We d we don't know whether
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that to what extent people do it or not ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we've got so few buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that it that actually makes that redundant .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : no ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : cer certainly wider angle than than current ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Comment-Understanding
A : we're all clear where we go from here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : thank you very much indeed
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .
