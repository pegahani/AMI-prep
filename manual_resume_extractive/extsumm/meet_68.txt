to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : does anybody have any initial ideas ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so touch screen design rather than button
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ?

dialogue type : Assess
D : An interesting option .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : there's such a problem with losing them ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I like the idea of the uh multi plate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : there used to be those whistling devices

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that you could place something else

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and it makes the remote page .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : Or if you our users in mind ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : they're used to the buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
