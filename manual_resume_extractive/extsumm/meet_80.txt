dialogue type : Suggest
A : And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : they're very boring ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um . Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : people won't see it as a remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think something that's comfortable to hold
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so something that's more comfortable
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : that fits in a person's hand better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : whereas if you want
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : could all be flat

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : fi find the button buttons easily .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we could have parallel marketing s schemes
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : They they just need to be very very dependable
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because people sort of take them for granted

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . Uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : how you can get the different um what are they called ? Like the face-plates

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so people can get different different things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Again I don't think that's ever been done before ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you could come up with like novelty ones ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we've got um a good idea now .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised .
