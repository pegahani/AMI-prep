to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I thought it was only for television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
