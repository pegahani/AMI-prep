to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use ,

dialogue type : Inform

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion

dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market
to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : So it would really would need to um

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay ,
to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay ,
to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition ,
to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan ,
to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if you need some help , uh so let me know .
to --> C

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control
to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas ,
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
D : It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition ,
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Assess
D : uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new ,

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
D : Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design ,
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then it's gotta be simple to use .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : because you know what she is going to do it , okay ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for ,
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ?

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yes , that's you have to decide , okay ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay .
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan .
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Offer
B : So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work ,

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay ,

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Offer
B : Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .

A : But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work ,
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay ,
