to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .

to --> D,C,B,A
