dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics .
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : I goin I'm going to share with you .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , I just put d quickly Remo ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Any ideas ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh the Powerstick .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe a Spanish name would work well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Mando .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : What does it mean in Spanish ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So , let's go for Mando ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you could have the fonts you know special ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Something that should be addressed later
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We should we should go to other for the other topics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well maybe it could be a universal design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : it could be command control kind of thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : user i interface could be of two types ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : That increases the the cost also .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Actually I'm not so sure

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We should bring new technologies for young peoples ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : of increasing the unit price .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we don't go for speech recognition technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so you have to work on the component uh concept .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh you have to work on user interface ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and you have to go through a trend watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .
