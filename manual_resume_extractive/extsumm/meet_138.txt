dialogue type : Inform
A : We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Alright , Trendwatch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the last point is easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well we have to choose one of them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So it must be very bright , very colourful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fruit and vegetables are cool .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the buttons of course rubber ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think everyone agrees .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um under forty five years old .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And also they like curved round shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But solar energy is not very practical inside a house ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But we do use an L_C_D_ screen ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um it's not really speech recognition ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : No it doesn't does not do anything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So you have a menu button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then you can go up and down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I suggest a banana shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : m Next year that's out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the video button should be uh an apart button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is my suggested design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , fine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Nah th It's too expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Alright .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So it f falls over the hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I will design it , we design it later .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well a case ? Uh that's me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And then the front is made of plastic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you can put that on and off ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But the feel of plastic isn't strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Titanium back , plastic front .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but you know b Titanium is very basic colour ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um well we have our beautiful drawing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : and then I'll put it in our end report .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we can launch a couple of packages .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Launch different lines at once .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and that they want more .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah but you you can have some basic colours ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe a a cheap voice recording .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We all agree on that . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Industry designer , . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but uh you'll get uh the specifications .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah . Round .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well yeah . Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh I I'd say only the logo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , our slogan is not very long .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But you can put it on the back ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Right corner , yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Ah the logo should be on the top I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : The logo can be on on every uh front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo
to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : and logo also on the front

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So uh a little corner of titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , that's great .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Can you draw it now ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .
