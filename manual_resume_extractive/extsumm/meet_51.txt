to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Right um this is our conceptual design meeting ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the minutes from the last time .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've decided on there being a flip design
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and um a different shape from what's normal .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There's um actually no rechargeable option available ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : dynamo charging ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you wind up your remote control before you use it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like the the solar charging ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : it like it runs for long time ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : W w which one would last the longest ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but you could you could have lights behind the buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : there's the plastic
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : well you could go for wood
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but I think it would be a bit impractical .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Titanium um very expensive just to process ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so perhaps uh some something made of rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I don't see why the curved thing is a problem ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : if we for example had a shell , once we open that

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : You could have a flat screen inside , yeah ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but I I think they could get a bit easily lost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we we we would not change h that particular pattern

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm not sure how long we've got left ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Do we agree on the battery ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um , that means that there's no function for li the port ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The L_C_D_'s not cheap .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we could start with the black and white .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : For the body design I think plastic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : This would definitely be different enough ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And incorporating the company logo ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think you just address that with um advertising .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , depending on the expense of it .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Right I'm going to wrap it up there .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : it says , closing we have forty minutes
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .
