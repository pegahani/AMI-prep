A : Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we will have again three presentation , from all of you ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So , the more frequent buttons should be larger ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So there will be some circuit uh for the power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : how big is it in reality ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But I I think we can we can cut it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So so for the same price we have four screens now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh first I think energy it's a key problem

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so no problem in energy , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Could you re could you redesign your board ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I dunno if it can fit with the technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : The screen has to be square ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So we are agree with the banana thing ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's like more more expensive to have shape like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , peeling of the banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Is it is it possible to do that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we add also the speech recognition device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype ,
