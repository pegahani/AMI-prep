to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is our second meeting

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : Um , right our agenda for today ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We discussed a flip-open design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um reducing the size of the control
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : three presentations , I've got written here so
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : shall we hear from Marketing first ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : Um is it okay if I postpone that til later ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Okay this is uh the working design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and try and take some inspiration from that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but those can be quite bulky
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and that's because of the size of the batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , now the ones at the moment are small
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : all age groups from fifteen upwards
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and um we observed them in the lab ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Our findings , lots of findings ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I've just summarised some of them here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and in the older age group it kind of reverses ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we have new project requirements , um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we're not going to be using teletext ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : our control is only going to be for T_V_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it's not going to be a combined control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : I don't know , what do you think ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Would that imply video use ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so we want logo ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we want um fashionable , trendy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm thinking kind of Japan ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm thinking uh young , um office people ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay , so the remote control functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we have to design one product

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we've got the T_V_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've got the video ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Video plus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I've not come across that function

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Instruction manuals .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : for a phone maybe he might walk down the street ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Um , what other functions ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Rechargeable with a docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , th the shape you got trendy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You could have different kind of casings .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So it's no teletext ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's only for T_V_ and by implication video ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : um something about Videoplus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's not at the moment a requirement ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I think you can email me , if there's any more questions .
