to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We've got a cool prototype .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : everything uh that we wanted
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Double curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um but also something that was gonna jump out at people ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That certainly does .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But we can have both uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Have them in stock .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : but it's just easy enough to go through it with you ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we're going for the kinetic power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the case , we've gone for the double curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and it's made out of rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : well they're in diff special colours ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Special form ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We're under budget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so we evaluate each criteria .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I would give it a seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : As in it's not .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Oh sorry , one , d yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Second criteria , new technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Maybe three , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : So criteria three is is it easy to use ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : not if you're left-handed it's not .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Kay , criteria four is costs .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's come in under budget .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So that's a definite one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Amount of buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Contains only the necessary buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : R_S_I_ is it good against ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yes . Very good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : does it get lost ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But it is smallish .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : We've , we've done well .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : So that's the evaluation ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Number one product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and be you know , has been good communication going on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Now you guys have been a a great team .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I love it . I love it . I think it's cool .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .
