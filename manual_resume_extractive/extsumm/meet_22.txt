A : Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh so we will see our three presentations .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh , I don't think so ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And the price is fairly cheap for this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the third one is uh about the the the image of the company .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's That mean we should use the colour of our company
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And then we can move on to the more advanced features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so so we keep all these all these buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we've got channel and volume . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We should hide them somewhere .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I mean a power button's obviously
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : uh required .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Okay , so we should keep this button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : A button is better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : What about things like the clock and um timers ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Probably not .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : W In my opinion we should have only useful thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh you are going to work on your individual works .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .
