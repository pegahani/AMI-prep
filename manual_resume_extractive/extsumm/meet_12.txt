dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And here's the agenda for this meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And then we're gonna evaluate it .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Then we're gonna talk about finance ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we implemented the basic functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : cradle ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : scroll wheel for uh the the channels ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Scrolling through your favourites list .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I like the the the the logo on there as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so this is the cradle unit ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is the teletext .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the red area is like a rubber covering .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
B : Beep beep beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I gotta do mine up at the board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We've got the features ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we have the uh characteristics ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The the corporation stands behind the product , okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay so we can talk about finance now .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I have a little spreadsheet for us

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's single-curved ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : See it's a little bit more than f single-curved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So yeah it's fifteen point eight ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we haven't talked about any special colour though

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's a scroll .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : then we have fifteen point eight Euros .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : How how have we done today ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think we did pretty well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Sh I think there was plenty of room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we we ended up being quite creative there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : These cables suck .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So yeah the the pen came in alright
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What new ideas have we found ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Are the costs within the budget ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Not the original budget , but they are now .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we need to close this meeting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Is the project evaluated ?
