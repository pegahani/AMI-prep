to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and we should each have a presentation to make .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we have certain decisions to make

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um there are the decisions we have to turn to ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but we'll come back to them in a minute
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then Steph did a second presentation
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and having a docking place as a selling point .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which was uh current cost of the competition devices ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I investigated the remote control market in greater detail ,
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : What's hot ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fruit and veg . Spongy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : This is really interesting change from past years ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because it is much more organic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Functional is out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : This is twice as important as the next finding ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which is technologically innovative .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : This is interesting ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Ease of use . Again , pretty low ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean it's the top three ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : They could be interchangeable ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : they're spongy ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So what we're talking about is changing . this concept .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Everyone has a T_V_ remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I was thinking titanium myself .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I have been influenced by pictures of iPods ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think many of us would associate those with fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it would be uh a a very simple product
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is the innards of a remote control um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and that's the the back of the interface .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this is a push-button one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that go through onto the the board at the back
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and they push these buttons here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We got to have something that pushes the little buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that um talk to the chip
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that encodes the message
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that sends the the message to the receiver .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We can have a hand

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a wind-up , yeah ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Or we we had talked about solar power ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : what does the interface look like ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we can have scroll buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you can have it like on a mouse
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and push to select something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um you can have multiple scroll buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but this will increase the cost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't know what that is ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but I think they think it's quite important

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I I think we've got two options .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We can either go for a really cheap model ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : keep all of the costs down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and it could have multiple scroll buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm afraid I don't have that information available .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which would allow um say a banana ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says ,
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um what functions we actually need ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It has uh scroll wheels without without a display ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you can scroll along

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but still quite simple and quite cost effective .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I was thinking , yellow and black ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : just because that's the company's colours ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I mean titanium would be great ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And I quite like it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it's got these easily reachable buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think I think that's a g nice clean design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But they all have this this feature of this uh It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But we can implement it with simple push buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we could call like a fruit name ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : This is actually the volume up and down ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but they both say V_ on them ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You were saying that the kinetic would be useful ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : unfortunately I don't have costing information .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I've used kinetic in terms of watches

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you don't even notice um that it's there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I've never come across it before ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but it sounds fantastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : a good selling point .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Mm .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : um and I would certainly recommend it , I think ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Um what about the case ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I think we've discussed not having titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we've sort of eliminated wood .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We said plastic or rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um the next part they want is the user interface concept .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : I'd like push buttons with

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um this is gonna sound weird ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Marketing they want product evaluation .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the look and feel design is for Kate ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh Steph gets the user interface design ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : you get product evaluation .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And that's the end of this meeting .
