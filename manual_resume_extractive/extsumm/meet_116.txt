to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform

dialogue type : Offer
B : I make a cat of it .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I just draw too quick I think .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : but you actually got to write on the paper .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it's just a picture .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's not that cool as I th thought it would be .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Now we just have to save everything ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we have to uh use a big market in Europe .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The production cost are about half the price of selling price ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You have to put it exactly on the on the

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : My laptop is crashing .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh actually my laptop doesn't work ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Okay . I think it works .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : How does this work ?

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Press F_ eleven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : that's a good question .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , it probably would be universal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we we just say we just say that's universal remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so a lot of buttons on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : what what what's a remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's just a black thing with some buttons on it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we can try to make it special .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : And how big should it be ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : It shouldn't be too big ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I don't think we can make it too small ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : maybe more trendy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Fold open ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : where you can see uh more options . I think

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You can put games on your remote control . Whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : And uh how about the batteries ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Uh should you put it in a recharger

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Ma maybe a home station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : because maybe it's too expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but a home station is uh a really good idea ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : or you can change your batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The option , just the option , that's cool .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh I I set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh the buttons on usable places ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh the the on off button must be on top ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh it has to lay good in the hand ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you can um have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But the rest is uh you don't use that often ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh on on top are the the basic options on top ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just think about it .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have uh another thirty minutes ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : so then we're going to meet again .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : what's in the market ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's already a document in the folder about it .
