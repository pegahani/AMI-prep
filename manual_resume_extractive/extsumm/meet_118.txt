dialogue type : Offer
A : I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're going to talk about the conceptual model .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we just talked about it looks .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Has to look nice .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Usability is very important .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It has to be very basic ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : not too many buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Light switches on if you use a button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it has to be easy to learn .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I received an email

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it's very important for us to create something new .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It uh is twice important as the following .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But we already have the flashing flashing light

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : We already discussed that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So I took uh that part of the webpage .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But it's about uh clothes and shoes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Spongy , like sponge .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So rubber , kind of .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh soft materials .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's also a stress-ball .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think about changeable fronts .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And uh some basic uh colour fronts .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We have to discuss about that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : how do we do that ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Maybe speech ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We ma must have some kind of gadget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It's very uh difficult to to to do it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : that's the problem . That's the main problem .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But maybe it's cheap
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it's easy to implement .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Since you have to uh configure speech thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We have to decide on that .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I got an email uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : They say uh a display requires an advanced chip .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And this is more expensive than all the other chips .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : And speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , probably too .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I I haven't got anything about speech recognition ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I had uh to make a sort of a design .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : So I did some searching on the internet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : just modern modern but still uh basic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And here you just have one , few buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : uh I definitely think we should go like this .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then changeable fonts ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's the most important part , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And the home base is something like that , something simple .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't find it very usable ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : That's on on the display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That th there is no display there .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But it's on the place of the display .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So the focus is on these two parts .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you don't see all the buttons you else need .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But it sounds very difficult to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So you can't use your thumb for it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : here we have also side scrolls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : for volume . For volume , or a channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : then we can even simplify it more .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : By just putting the volume on the side .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And and just channel buttons here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The channel buttons are often used .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you can't use them now with your thumb ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : m maybe we cho should put that on top ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : You mean uh these to the low ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Except from the on-off button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So maybe we can put that on the bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But uh we we can switch those two ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the component design .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : this was on the web site .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not Nothing square-like .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : iPod is trendy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And it is well curved square .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the colours also .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Still still transparent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah . But with all with logo on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we have to make it from soft material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But anyways uh it should be transparent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just give five with them , just in a box . Five different

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : With the hard hard buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think uh rubber really has an odd look .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it don't come out of the on the background .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's it's all on one level .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So that should be hard plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : basic remote control from normal plastic ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : the rounds of it from softer s

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And back light L_E_D_s .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But I think we have to make the case transparent ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but I think there are multiple colour LEDs .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : And in green colour , the back lights

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Re recharger . Base station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh a chip , that's this one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um for the energy source we can use batteries

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Or we can also use solar cells .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But you mostly use it indoors ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's dark in the room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It's just batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um cases ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : flat , so uncurved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And three D_ curved is also in depth .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we can't use the flat buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um these kinda materials can be used .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we just make it plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The scroll wheels , that's cool .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : That's for the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh the L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I don't think that's an opportunity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Uh are are we using a a rubber case ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : Uh I don't think a rubber case looks

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : fruit and veg can be just the covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I can't imagine a soft remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : just hard plastic ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Not the sh the square form .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you can make it curved or mm round .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But just in two D_ , not in depth .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : more rounded .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the energy uh is the recharger .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Just a normal battery .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the case is just a plastic one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : That's for the next one .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : But you definitely get a specific instruction .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But th think about something that's more rounded .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Like a very big scroll-wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think uh zapping is the highest priority .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we have to care that it r uh looks really new .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but i i it should be round in in shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You have to look at that image of the iPod .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , five . Let's give five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe you can buy separate ones

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : you could put it like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so top down .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Do we have to design that w as well ?
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : The docking station ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I dunno . I dunno if it's handy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we have to make a decision ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And you have the scroll button inside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : No rubber buttons or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Doesn't have to be .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : though that's a trend . If we want to make it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : do we s keep that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But you'd definitely need a
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : advanced chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And we we have to build in a microphone

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But we don't have any f information about the cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is a very small electronic unit ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it works like uh good morning remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then the remote control says good morning .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's integrated in the chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : it it would be would be a good feature feature .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We have to stop it now .
