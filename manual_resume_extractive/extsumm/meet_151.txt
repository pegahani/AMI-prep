A : Detailed design

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Prototype presentation , well first

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's basically what we agreed upon ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but just a little bit more specified .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So we have it's a bit round shaped ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have battery power ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so I had to take out the special colour I suppose .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could take out the curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Can we then not also uh change the material ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We take plastic for the basic cover

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We can put those to the to the other covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Rubber would increase durability

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But we can take a risk .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's not our decision to take .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but the one that g has given us the order to design this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : yeah , it's true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So that's what we gotta go with .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : just to get it through final ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : I say lose the curve . Oh that's true ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I second that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we keep the curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're final on that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could just discuss how the project went .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : because it's good .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I uh will pre present uh some statements
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : So so the buttons , the look and feel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : One and a half .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : so I think it that's that deserves a one . Definitely .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : And the next one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Manual .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it it is pretty straight-forward .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I thought that people wanted previews on their

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I don't think it's possible really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So that could be done by L_C_D_ display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean the shape is trendy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The the sh the the functions are trendy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Maybe we should go with a two then ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
B : Overall score .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : Two and two thirds .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We could have used it more efficiently ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we did pretty well as team-work though .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Triple R_ it is .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : have to write my report now , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , sure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : What do we scrap .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible .
