A : Welcome to the conceptual design meeting

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited . information .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I will take notes
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I'll be talking about the components .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh below forty five and above .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : senior citizens uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Or you can go for both ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : That's it's custom customisable and

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I I prefer rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : At first , the colours of fruit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah . They like spongy material ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , uh materials like wood that

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They have to look fancy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , they should be technological in innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , and easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And uh make the menu structure changeable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay . So the games uh are in it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The voice recognition are not .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And the parental control are

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But you still have the problem about uh the television itself .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We take it to the other meeting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that .

dialogue type : Inform
A : I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : That spins around like all the time .
