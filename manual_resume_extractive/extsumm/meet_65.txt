to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : This is our functional design meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
A : our agenda today um

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um . I'm gonna do an opening ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : did you all get the minutes ?
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I e-mailed them to you .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and have your three presentations .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : or if I'm the only one who is .

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : How do I hook my screen up ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And then you have to press function F_ eight

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I I think you just have to push it in really hard .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I think that ties back to what you were saying before
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : just that there's too many buttons ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : It also mentioned something called R_S_I_
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : Repetitive strain injury .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : it sends a message to the television

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product ,
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : h how well these particular prototypes work ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the first of these is is technological

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh we need to find a balance between features and price .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : things like voice recognition would would add to the price
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so it's one that's got lots of buttons ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : The one on the right is a lot more basic .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : everything you might possibly want to do is there ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : that's ergonomically designed .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : did it let you go on the Internet

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then I'm like wait it won't let me google .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is our working design presentation .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um I had a bit of some issues with this ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because I wasn't able to find everything I needed ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the user interface is critical here ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We need a chip that works well with the user interface ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : requirements . We have a couple new requirements

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : but we're not gonna work with teletext

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : What's teletext ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh , it's a British thing .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's earl it's pretty old technology .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um otherwise becomes to complex ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's like double R_ .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we need to talk about our functions and our target group .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's all specific for speech recognition .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I would say no ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because it's gonna add too much to the price .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ?
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : or we can look at um user-friendly .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : or also have the other ones just separate somehow

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : that had like the main buttons
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and then you could like pull something out ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : what are we emphasising ? I what in this project ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Si simplicity and fashion .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think it's a lot to do with battery ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So 's just the quality of the chip .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : S voice recognition ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : It's it's hard to narrow it down .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ?
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Like a button on a T_V_ you can press

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Which are kind of hidden away in some way

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
A : that's that's a good idea ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : After that we have thirty minutes of individual work .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept ,
to --> C,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : User Interface , the user interface concept ,
to --> D,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : market trend wa watching .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Other
A : And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Hopefully it is there for people .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .
