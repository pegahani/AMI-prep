to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then we'll have a bit of discussion .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : what I've just found out from the board

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but it needs to be television only .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're not doing D_V_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's red and black .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and no teletext .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm not sure what teletext is

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : For reasons that I don't really know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but it's the board so there you go .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we'll discuss it later

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um remote control works as follows .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um sends message to another system ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there's an integrated circuit ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which is the microchip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A user interface controls the chip ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um too much metal is used sometimes

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Um , components . Just some ideas that I had ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : um , energy source ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it's kinda hip to be eco friendly
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Um the user interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : since we can't use metal
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause it is the industry standard ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and uh probably a two hundred foot range .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Um personal preferences ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah that shouldn't be a problem .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it needs to be universal
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh this remote control has many functions

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but it uh it is quite complicated
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because they don't know how to use them
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um . Another remote control , slightly different ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Um it also has a bit of a cheap look
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and it's also quite boring .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : my personal preferences .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we had a usability test
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and see what it is that they're using
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then they filled out a questionnaire
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the majority of the time that's all that's going on ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : for some people they're important ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the other functions happen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but the primary uses are really really basic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but it is s something worth thinking about ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um but we need to decide who are we selling this to ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : um so do we wanna go for that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : or do we want to go for an older demographic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um think we're constrained to plastics

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but we might be able to say um volume up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : With a simple command like locate .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then it could start to beep

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : Are we still thinking about this screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'S definitely an option technically .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : We could have the casing , the the face plates .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : whereas you're just sit at home ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah I think that would be best .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : With a touch screen for the basic functions . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : 'Cause it would have a docking base ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But then again that costs as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : What what would be on that touch screen ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : logo or something or motto ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : They just want it to be on and ready to go .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But then again who wants to turn on a remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : all you have to do is touch the screen
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it automatically goes on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : or go into like a dormant mode .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and the minutes that I'll do it in a second
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and put them in the shared folder for later reference .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I've put my files in the shared folder as well .
