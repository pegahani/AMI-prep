to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay and the agenda will be the opening

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : you have to have microphone
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : it has to it has to hear the speaker

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so it could be in the television set , could be in the device ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and we contacted manufacturing for their input
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so then we were thinking about um rubber ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so um we still had titanium and and wood available ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And um then there was the regular which
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : now jumping right to our personal preferences
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that people will might really want to design their own cases ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .

to --> A
dialogue type : Offer
C : but I'll find out more at our next meeting .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because um it gets brittle , cracks

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
A : So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .

to --> C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So , it's a very short presentation ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .
to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And also um you had issues with the batteries running out ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .

to --> D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Be like a copper hinge or you know .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : But you also have to d start watching out for the weight ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I also have a f very simple presentation ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I also have uh copied a different type of remote .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause uh trends change very very quickly .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Looking for next generation of innovation ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The first one , I see that they put in a display .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Maybe the display also makes it easier to use ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .

to --> C
dialogue type : Assess
B : But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then they sold millions , millions .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we might wanna um learn about um labour laws .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : We're here to design , come up with a nice product .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I mean I think it's a good idea ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Once we get a price on it then we can market it .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : A customisable and

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think they could be rubber like they are now ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .

to --> C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .

to --> C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay ,
to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : then uh , then we can proceed from there .
