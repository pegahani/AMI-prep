to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the agenda of the meeting is opening .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : to take the minutes of the meeting .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And there are three presentations .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : One is uh new project requirements .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh finally we are closing .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : management come with the new proposal ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and I have to discuss a few points on this .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the second one is about uh the remote control .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Should be used only for the T_V_ .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : thought we better look at things that are popular
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and um ex go beyond those ,
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : you could throw it at things
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : But um I just took some different uh schematics

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : personal preferences , um

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So something that's very very flexible and inflatable

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : be very colourful ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : or you could make it clear ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and um kind of blend in with things ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because uh sometimes they fall into cups

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I don't know if it's actually understood my message ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and the kids throw it

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder ,
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Titanium would be be heavy , too ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : um I wanted feedback ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I like titanium .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Expensive .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I know the project plan and the budget .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I will I will send you a mail ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : how much its cost for the manufacturing
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and how much it's going to be we sell in the market .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and it will be slim ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : Might be hard to find , though .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs , okay , the functional designs .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : from the marketing yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : then it w it could possibly sell .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but maybe simple commands .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : louder , softer , on , off .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use .
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So maybe one word speech recognition commands ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : say remote , and there's a beep beep beep ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But if it's trendy ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if it's fancy ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it's got some colour to it ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if it's very easy easy to use ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design .
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But , price obviously we have to talk about .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : training is always an issue with uh commands .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : But um anyway , um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : or maybe uh set it out in the sun

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Be-Negative
D : Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : what I can uh suggest to you , Christine ,

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : because they're already in this uh speech recognition part ,

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what today .

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management
to --> A,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and s be more s precise .
to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : What do they want ?
to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ?
to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?
to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Because it has to be something totally different ,

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : but end of the day , you're the sales guy ,

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : they want something uh new ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : And uh I hope I can convince the management on that ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products .
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , in our case , existing remote controls .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um and then what the remote control should look like ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : You need to be able to control the volume
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : here we've got two examples
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : they're labelled ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .

to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
C : that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me ,
to --> B
dialogue type : Offer
A : and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : to help you for uh make a design uh slim ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : do we actually want to incorporate all of them ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : or have we missed anything ?

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide ,
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : maybe that would provide some guidance ?

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : it says individual actions ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : so I'm supposed to do the components concept ,
to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : supposed to work on the user interface concept ,
to --> D,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you're supposed to keep watching the trends .
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and eliminate them later in the process ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ?
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause w our meeting time has run out .
