to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we decide what it's gonna be .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Probably plastic . Uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we need the infra-red transmitter .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And solar cells , I dunno about that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um . And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh one is a flat one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Double curved . It probably means this is probably double curved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh whereas a single curved would be like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : it looks better than the single curve ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh you can't have it in titanium ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : there's trade-offs there . Um

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : you have to decide ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We have to look into the costs of those .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : translate the key press into an infra-red signal
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and this is received by the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um and then maybe use single curved uh case .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I also have a preference for rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and pretty much decided to just dump them all .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I wasn't very impressed by them

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You must have two two modes ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that it should be , you know , soft to touch

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and this would need to be articulated as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and menu mode would be the enter button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Programming them can be a right pain .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : As in they want it to do a lot of good s

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and if it does do a lot that's a bonus ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but they don't care so much ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Technology technical technologically innovative . People want it to be that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like the interface is really important .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And easy to use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : How that relates to a remote control I don't know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Spongy .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : kinda spongy material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : or we stay totally away from it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Few questions about a spongy remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I've never seen one before .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And also , this was this year .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : things change all the time , every year

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : say something like um lithium ion battery ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Looks like we going for a double curved design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : organic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Sure , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Make it harder to lose , as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : y you lose the banana ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you press a button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you s you click a button
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it finds the frequency
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that works with your particular television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : looking from prototyping of some des description using clay .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : At this stage we still have no no target audience

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um you're gonna look at product evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : though maybe we could have options for colours as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um .
