to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh now we're going um into the functional design .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Then our agenda .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : first the opening .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Uh this time I will take the minutes .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : My name is Freek Van Ponnen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm the Market Expert .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : where we observed um users operating remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : these are three quite astonishing results , I thought .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um in addition remotes were not very functional .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Then we did some research to the most relevant functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The power button got a nine .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And teletext got a six and a half .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Then there are some one-time use function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Which are not really used very frequently ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but are still considered to be of some importance .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They are not really very interested in features .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should make very few buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But it might be a good idea to make a docking station .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And this would , could get a button in it
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : which would send a signal to the remote
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : which would then beep .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So you'd know where it is in the room .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : This would also greatly increase the production costs
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : and not much information about it , Um about uh interface

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But uh it must be uh user-friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah . Uh uh uh Yeah . In one um remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : My personal uh preferences um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And um here you've got a s kind of a display .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : It's a touchscreen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : N I I don't think so .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : it would certainly make a fancy design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But the It wouldn't be very robust .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I've got a presentation about the working design .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Um first about how it works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Everybody knows how a remote works .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The user presses a button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The remote determines what button it is ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we've got um the the plate .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It gots conductive disks for every button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : When the user presses a button , a signal got sent ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : goes to the LED
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : this is a schematic overview .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You've got the buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The power source .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think we should use default materials , simple plastics .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Keep the inner workings simple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : so I'm here to mess things up
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and uh tell you some new uh requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um that's because uh it will be too complex
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : within the next like twenty years is very slim .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Standard remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh I think teletext can be uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Is anybody um really against teletext ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So we can s we can skip the display ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But do you need the buttons for one to zero .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Think if you're gonna include teletext you do .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : maybe we can implement the scroll button ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Or a joystick like ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it's very important in the in the design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : we're just gonna focus on the extras ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you have it's on some phones too ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which have a docking station .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And you just press a button
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and the phone goes ringing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : point is the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Uh another

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : which would explain a button if you press it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Just the L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That's a good idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : target the real elderly people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But I'd have to look into that a little more .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : adapt it to different cultures .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : In different languages , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : If we're able to really bring an innovative product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we're focusing on elderly people here
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : User Interface Designer the user interface concept ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and the trend-watching .
