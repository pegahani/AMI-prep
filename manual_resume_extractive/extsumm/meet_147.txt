to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : The remote control offers enough features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's it's about one point five . Something like that .

to --> ,B
