dialogue type : Inform
A : This is our last meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um then we'll do the evaluation ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and a spongy feel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : basically we we st went with the colour yellow .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we could use the voice .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's as simple as you , we could make it really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Plastic covered with rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : T the actual thing might be smaller .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's a quick on-off button .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : With seven being false , we did not achieve that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Four is fair .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Did we make it simple for new users ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's very intuitive , I think yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : So that's a one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Y you could add an extra feature actually .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That can't cost much .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Let's add one of those features and say yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Are we technologically innovative ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um I would say we're probably at four .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Um spongy material ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : We have some spongy , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's not a one though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Probably a four at most .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : did we put the fashion in electronics ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I'd say we did .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now we just gotta calculate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay we'll say two point four two .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Now we get to do the budget numbers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We want a fifty percent profit on this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Case materials are

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : That's not a special colour .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So our total is fifteen point five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : by three Euros over .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Right . We may not need it .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : But I'd like to hear your thoughts .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Uh h what did you think of our project process ?

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : yeah I think we did quite well . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Super super .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I had some problem with the pen I think ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .

dialogue type : Offer
A : And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
