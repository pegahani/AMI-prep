to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um something that looks good
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and uh show us the prototype .
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think if we both step up
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and uh outline our ideas .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that could then just be turn uh twisted round ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Really the curve that's most needed is the underside

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : because it's gonna be flat on one side ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And it's plastic as well ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So it has a wee sort of tail
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that you just drape over your wrist

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : seven scale .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria ,
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : we average that

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : those are the criteria .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better ,
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned ,
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : we have to go through each point .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : and just give it a a score .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , that's still part of the design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Mm . And making it a bright colour helps

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we still have that noise thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I'd say number one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and then we'll come back to the product evaluation

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Something I neglected from my initial research

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we can come back to it , you said .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Slight problem we had
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've got point two of a Euro left over there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so I've used what I think's appropriate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We've got an advanced chip ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've got the use of the L_C_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I really think as m much as it pains me
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : You now have as much information as I do . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I've said single curved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this one comes in under price as you can see ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh no , we haven't , not

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's too expensive

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Mm . I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it can still be single curved ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and focus on the menu being the best interface ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's that voice response thing that we got the email about .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But I thought it was just completely pointless .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I quite like that colour that you're fetching there ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : make it glow in the dark even better .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we'll come back to uh your evaluation

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Three . I think we can do three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Reduce the number of unused buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I'd say we're doing well there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : we're not doing so badly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : Um easy to use

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : let's forget that one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Fancy looking .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It doesn't get much fancier .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Technologically innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we're getting rid of the locator thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Mm . I'd give it a three for this for that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Materials that people find pleasing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Plastic , it sucks .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : that's totally thrown everything off balance .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Leopard print would be cool .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It would also help keep the the product placement

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Is this like a banana type colour ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's not shaped like a banana is

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Mm . I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and we can make it yellow ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and that's pretty much banana like .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , I'll go with five .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Other
C : we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
to --> 
dialogue type : Other
C : So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Which gives us an average of three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it's it's not bad .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Probably the people technologically .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : of the researchers studying this .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Good .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : yeah I liked it ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Very good .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Um last one we've got is room for creativity .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Negative
D : We're burs bursting with creativity .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : We we're not lacking in ideas ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think we needed a larger budget .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Mm . I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah , to begin with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um m would make to sales .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : before I quickly write up a final report .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but we've got something

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and then we can finish up the writing and such .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff .
