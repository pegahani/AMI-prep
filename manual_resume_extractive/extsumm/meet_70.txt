to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : this meeting will be about the conceptual design ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : apologies for the last meeting ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but we're gonna have to get into more detail

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : which we probably don't wanna do ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : curved or very sexy double curved .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um , I imagine that we could specify .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but to use those we'd have to use more chips ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : touch screen equals many chips
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : which equals many Euro .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but in fact there is light coming out of the remote

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : is there an option that we can have that off or on
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : so a person can select like

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
B : I am sure that we could do that .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : just as a fun gimmick .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : or should we just make do with what we have available ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I'd say shop around
to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : My personal preference is

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and what's going on in other design fields ,
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : um that we need innovative design options
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and there needs to be an easy user interface .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Different skin options ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : it has a consistency of those stress balls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I like the idea of of rubber too

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Here's a d series of different remote controls
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : that are out on the market today .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : um and basically you record your own verbal labels
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : c and connect them to the remote control .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like you could say good morning uh remote control
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Now we kind of have to come to some decisions ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's our most marketable feature

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : But can we really afford it

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's just an estimate though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?

to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's just off the top of my head ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but that's something that we can have finance deal with .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and we can look into this other manufacturing option ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean I think that we really have two main selling points ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause with voice recognition

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that our casing and the voice recognition

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we might have to drop the voice rec .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and they said they wanted voice recognition .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Does having both really up our costs ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : I can't see how it wouldn't ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we have to pick between one of the two . Um .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the voice recognition is simpler ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : we're not gonna have to do as much design work

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : You discussed either a lithium or a solar power .
to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , the solar power definitely would be
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we should install a small backup battery .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and maybe kind of have a round remote control
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we have to have buttons on it too as well .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it could still have the basic buttons on it .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And maybe a menu button and so forth ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm thinking of the airport portal ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Comment-Understanding
D : you know like that little pod looking thing ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Terracotta bowl or something .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Just kind of the squishy feel .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost ,
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Like maybe have menu things .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could do a slide or a compartment ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player .

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use ,
to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons

to --> A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because you have different cases
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and that might open up your market a little bit obviously ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but obviously having more cases also costs more

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's work on uh multiple case colours .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype .
to --> C,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And um Ron if you can
to --> C,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .
