to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Are we doing the the speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Simply a square with uh round corners .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh the material should be hard plastic .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The functions are just basic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Mute function , on-off function , text functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Only one button to say it's on or off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's uh twelve buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Okay , maybe we use this button for the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart .

dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And h how does the second level come out ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh it slides uh along ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .

dialogue type : Inform
C : So here are multiple speech buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I don't know how many .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh menu buttons with arrows .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Colour buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There's one text button I prefer .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That's a functionality for the television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it's one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Learnable ? Easy to use ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Then a two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : New features . Techno technological innovative ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But we didn't follow the latest trends .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah , you could make a a front

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Like a a f banana kind of front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we give ourself a three or something .
