to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : W why is the uh double curved two of them ?

dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and why why I've got it two , I don't know ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But you think it should be one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

C : Oh , I'll go for a one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh for me personally it is everything fine ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : but there is one thing which limits the customers ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like we are having only two , three designs ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : So we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Is that no is that not trends ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform

dialogue type : Assess
B : I have taken it very wrongly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um ,

dialogue type : Assess
D : so I would actually give it a three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It is cus spongy also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : So what about company strategy ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .
