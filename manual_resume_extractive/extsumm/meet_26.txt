to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I will take the minutes
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : you mm you three are going to do presentation .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : we need uh to know the the user uh needs

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : we want to know how it going to work

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : third part uh I don't remember

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's go for the three presentations ,
to --> D,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so first um Marketing Expert .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I am the expert in marketing
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Offer
D : and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : what they like ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : what they don't like

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : First of all , they find it very ugly .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I mean they're all the same ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Um what is interesting
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : people are very frustrated w with their remote controls
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and they for instance uh they don't even find it
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ?
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Like uh something to to like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : that nobody use ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh they are bad for R_S_I_
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but we have to take this into account .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : now I remember what is R_S_I_
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : it's repetitivity stress injury .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we've listed a couple of uh

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : Functions .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : but what is important
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : is to understand that the power button is not used often
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because in general you use it only once per session ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but it is very relevant .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : People want to have a power button .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Channel selection is uh o often used very often used

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Volume is not often used
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but people uh want to have control on volume

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : All of them . they're not often used
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and they are s more or less relevant .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : that it's out of date now because of internet .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and as we can see it really depends on the age .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so that's basically my findings .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : should we aim at the young people or not ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should aim at the young people .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Then teletext is useless for them I think ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : my name is Mark Dwight ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Offer
B : that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We should never complicate things too much .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So here is this remote control .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's quite a standard one ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it's not from a T_V_ ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : compared to this one

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Our question of the style , we should remember that our company
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : puts fashion into electronics

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : It is unbreakable
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and it is very universal .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : W we'll have a screen with a back light
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : which can change colours ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and we can put all the options into this screen .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We'll need only few buttons .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : All the other things can be controlled through the screen .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We need power and volume .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And let us include two nice features into this device ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : When you go to the sofa , take your control
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and point it to the T_V_ ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the T_V_ turns on .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And when does it turn off ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : When you don't touch the control

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : For for enough time

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Suppose you set u you set up some volume
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and take your control with you .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Uh I'm not sure about the screen ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?
to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : but uh it has to be with an back light somehow .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : So basically that's it .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_
to --> B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : Can be easily done ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it's quite universal you know .
to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We can just extend it to any device .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : In fact I would propose another solution .
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : Basically you use just four or five channels ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : like you can uh de you can just button the number

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and you can change mode zapping mode or

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so we can have more functions for T_V_

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Could we carry out some research if we w really need this ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Offer
D : I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so to do these functions we need an interface ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then it will process by the chip
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then it will generate some information to the main device .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : mainly the energy source like the battery
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we ought to have some kind of processor

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because the people don't use one particular brand so

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we need to check their specifications

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we need to have particular encryption codes .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Offer
C : so I'll input the connections to all this components .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And what about the price of this component ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume
to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : or or it will be something like volume , up , down .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : it will be complicated

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?
to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like
to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : roll 'em up
to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : or roll 'em down .

to --> C
dialogue type : Assess
D : Very expensive ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we're now going to l have the lunch break .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : you will focus on the component concept um
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : But speech recogniser can be possible .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Like , you want to find it , you shout

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and it answers is I'm here ? Or

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .

to --> D
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
B : Just beeps ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : You can clap . Can you ?

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : But it's a good feature I guess yeah

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : we're done ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's go to lunch .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so we try to only recognise those words
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and and because we can't really say user to say same wording
