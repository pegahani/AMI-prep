to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and our Industrial Designer , Baba .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the shape , there's two basic shape .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So there are several key features of our pr prototype .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : The first is that it is fuzzy .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Fruits and vegetables .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : And inspired colour
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and and very sophisticated material , so .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : the low level chips inside

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : The battery it is under .
to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : It is in th in in the base , yeah .
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , the shape is unique ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Looks like more fruit .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : It looks more like a pineapple .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And where is the voice recognition ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : No , the colour is okay , that's fine .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : but I would say there is more too much red .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Right . So , from one to seven ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Three .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's say it's a pineapple now .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : There four microphone .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : We have tactile buttons .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I see , you have microphone array embedded .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think technically it's acceptable , so

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I would say two

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : is it easy to use ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah but this this turning

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : and you can turn like that to change the channel ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think b but the the vocal command is easy too .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : So it's coarse to fine design .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : that's very technologic , so . Yeah .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : yeah it's a sleeping remote control .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : W that why we have the solar ti yeah .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : To compensate .

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it's easier than traditional controller .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : you have you just turn the turn the ball .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : it's reasonable three .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : But this this has to stay on the table , right ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : In fact on a flat place

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : You need to have everything in hand .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : You know tha that's the weak point ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : It need maybe some wo further work , but it's

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , especially on the easy to use

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we need to calculate the production cost .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : but we have solar cells .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh I think in each ball you have three

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Single simple chip on print ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And sample sensor , sample speaker .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : Mm . One maybe , yeah .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : So we are all already nineteen .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : The solar cell is too expensive .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have two special colours .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : So we have one button ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think there's a problem with the push push button .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : One s one scroll wheel , so

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's fine , twelve fifty uh

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay we I think we have problem .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we s if we keep on adding things

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Push button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Mm . Yeah , we have four .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think it's more like double curved .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .

to --> D,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so .

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yes . Of course . This is my job .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : So I think the costs are within the budget .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : do you think you can celebrate your creation ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Be-Positive
C : And you can celebrate your leadership .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we have give him give it a cute name .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's a pineapple remote controls .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : and we have a nearly final product .
