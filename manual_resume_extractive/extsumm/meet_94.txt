dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The meeting will be forty minutes long .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We could use a basic battery ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , or there's solar power ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we could use metal ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we could use rubber
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um right our choice for buttons as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um one thing with the scroll buttons though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we would have to have an L_C_D_ um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : My personal preferences ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we could go for the kinetic energy source .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : As far as I know . It should be .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
B : Like as a backup for something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : May maybe that could be the backup .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that might be a little impractical though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , there are two types of user interfaces .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm not really sure about the pictures that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It'd be more a command interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : to make it more simplistic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But what about the lighting up effect ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and well rubber is a more translucent product too ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we have that taken care of .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : this report is about uh trend-watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : and I'd like to stick to that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So maybe there could be animal-based , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It could even be one of our selling points .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So regular chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh , so that's the simple .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : is regular not simple ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : yeah , interchangeable plates .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and supplements .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What's that all about ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We haven't really decided what to do about that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : just just the basic button functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Should we have audio ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we don't know how other televisions work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And you'll be evaluating the product .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Like f five different

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : what do yous think of this ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .
