dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It uh it uh still some technical difficulties
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh the basic battery ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well , maybe a little bit expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Could be uh something special to our uh remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um , I still don't have any information about user requirements .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : these are the ones you already summed up in the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But you do mention the next and previous uh button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well , that's next channel . I mean next channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : uh personal preference I didn't have .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Stall
D : The younger market likes uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , catchy colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Maybe it's too much , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But , we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Well well what would you display on it then ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe just bring it out in different colours ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : How many colours are we gonna give it ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Like two-tone colour ? T
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Not more than two colours I think .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's a g a little bit too flashy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A mute and a teletext and a menu .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : In the shared folder .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : because I'm will now type them out .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : You'll see in you email , I guess .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : What are we going to do now ?
