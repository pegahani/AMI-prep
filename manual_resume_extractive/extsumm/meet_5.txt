to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Okay so welcome everyone .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the the goal is to have a remote control
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : First it will be the functional design .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Third is the conceptual design
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then is the desired design .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point .
to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's a cat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So Here the uh financial objective of our project .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So . Fit in your hand , yeah .

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
A : Water-proof as well .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : Maybe water-proof would be very original .

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : most of the time I I lose my remote control .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So i it's just going to add t to the cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay so try to find that for next meeting .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think that's all for this point .
