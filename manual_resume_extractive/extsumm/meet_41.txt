dialogue type : Inform
B : Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : so we're designing a new remote control and um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and so there are three different stages to the design .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : And repeat that process three times .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : My favourite animal is like
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A beagle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And , yeah that they have lots of personality

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Then they're small cute and furry ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I kind of like whales .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : They come in and go eat everything in sight .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : M my favourite animal is my own dog at home .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I imagine it probably is our sale actually
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um as well as uh characters ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So um for them it was just how many devices control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So extra functionalities .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
B : You keep losing them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe like a touch screen or something ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um for user interface , technical functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and uh marketing executive ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think one factor would be production cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it ,
