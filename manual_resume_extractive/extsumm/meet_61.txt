A : so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and , uh yeah , I'm just here to
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : sort of liaise between the three of you
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and get things going , get people talking
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'm gonna draw it on the board then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um the idea is that we've got the
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : energy source um ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um I think maybe uh two batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which could be uh an infra-red signal ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um which will be sent by an electronic chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Is a battery like the only way of

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : How about Bluetooth ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh channel keys up-down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I would say it's If it's simple to do ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Voice activation might not be the best .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we should probably consult with our legal department uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh and that would be infra-red ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : energy source , that would be batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Can't we have different colours in the remotes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : So we have to have it one colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .
