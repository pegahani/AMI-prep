to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .

to -->
