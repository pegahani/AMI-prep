to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : here we have our detailed design meeting
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : where we will um look at the prototype

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : since you could just use your voice .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : we have assembled our prototype , um .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , we took into account a lot of the things
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : that we went over in the last meeting , um .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is going to be the on off button
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and we have these buttons to go through the channels
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : um and then two volume buttons down here ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : um f we call it fruity

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : of course that's uh interchangeable
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : but this is kind of something that can be done
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : um and as you can see on the television there
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I worried about the materials ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I dunno if you noticed ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Um , did we come in under budget ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : to put this into um production , we're looking at about

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : It was twelve fifty Euro
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : um obviously we had a choice with the buttons
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but we just went for a classic rubber button

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote

to --> B,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : we didn't quite have enough material uh .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : as you can see this is just a most superficial layer
to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
B : and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's not it's not quite a a face plate ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : it's more like a pseudo-face plate

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and we could go the face plate way

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Very cool , nice job .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : you provided a number
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : that actually sounds quite nice .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if we can just itemize what's in here ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's a solar cell thing

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : With a back-up battery ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
C : The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : so maybe we've got two push button interfaces

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause it i it is very unconventional ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : M come in at sixteen ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : a bit over budget , um .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um or take out the back-up battery . Uh

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : and saying oh look my remote isn't working

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean that's what sets us apart

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell ,
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think unfortunately that's our best option .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
A : um , nor would changing the case materials .

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
B : Gotta do what you gotta do .

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I guess now we just go to the project evaluation

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : these are the things we needed to do ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : these are the things that look like we feel they're important .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um so I was looking at basic design things ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : are technologies up to where we hoped they would be

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Is the design what we wanted it to do ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : Does it respond to voice recognition ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : They like that spongy feel .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I got this slide from the coach

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I'm not sure what it's connected to .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and how that all worked , I guess , um .

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : As in within the team or ?

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think so yeah .

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Are we considering these points here ?

to --> B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think they're starting blocks

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive ,
to --> A,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : considering the little amount of input we had going in .
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Um , and the technology has definitely been a help ,
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : We didn't use the whiteboard at all .

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : No , no whiteboard .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all ,
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I didn't write barely anything .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Was pretty cool tack though .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Attempts to contact coach ineffective .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : n I think there was a lot of room for creativity ,
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : And even then we did get a decent product turned out
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : although it's not everything we wanted it to be .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think the teamwork was good as well .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Assess
B : My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What did you guys think about the the the roles ?

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it was pretty clever
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause we were never able to get too far off track
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : because the information came in at the right time
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and kind of filled in the gaps enough .
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all .
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Nothing , I didn't even get an email ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Be-Negative
D : I feel like that was slightly lacking

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was

to --> B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more ,

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you

to --> B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : And I think your leadership was quite good .

to --> A,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : It was really good yeah .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : I did get I I felt like I got way too into it .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ?

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think so .

to --> B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building ,
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires ,
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for .

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Usually I would do a lot more doodling too

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I felt like I needed to be professional

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like .

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : is this all we need to get through ?

to --> C,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I didn't change this one at all .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh I think they still do their job .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : how much can you do with a remote control ?

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : how long was our meeting supposed to be ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : at the beginning it started out
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I felt actually like under pressure

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : that you guys don't really care about anyway

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it

to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it
to --> A,D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : or edited 'em .

to --> A,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : My slides were all blank ,
to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : they'd have a title maybe

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : An interesting day all in all I would say .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we've established that the costs weren't really within budget ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it's all recorded ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : uh I will save this into the project documents .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : You guys ready to celebrate ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : that's our last step . Celebration .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I guess we'll call that a a doner .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : that's the end of the meeting .
