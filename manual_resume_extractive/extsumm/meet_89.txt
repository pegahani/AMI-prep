to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we've got new project requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So basically we've got three things ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : W I I got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We discussed that last time

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we've got uh teletext outdated .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I I got that in email form .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I've just got three sections ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the basic components are an energy source
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because that's obviously found in the television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a power supply
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we then have a particular button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : after you press that that sends the message to the chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's the components of the remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So this is the uh user interface .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : just because of the size .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and infra-red um has been used quite successfully .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and then the sender ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um here are two example remotes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um whereas the right remote is much simpler ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it looks much more user friendly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um so my personal preference would be the right remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's got a very limited number of buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , it's got nice big buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it's very very user friendly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So we could dispense with that little bit as well

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because that seems to be for a video as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And I don't really think that you need nine numbers .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um some remotes have kind of favourite options

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Limit the number of buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But I suppose nine's not really excessive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : How many buttons have we got ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We've just got ten , eleven twelve th

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : and um how do people use it ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And young people were quite receptive to this ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What was that last wee bit there ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um about speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you can press a button which is always kept in one place
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then they whistle back , or something like that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That'd probably be really simple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : a set command whatever that happened to be .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and you can give it a command ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it'll recognise the voice

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you could have an option to turn it off . Or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well if it does then we can't .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because time to market is is critical . S

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : clapping , I think clapping ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but that again is probably an expense that

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you don't use it that much ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : That is that is a good idea actually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And that'll be better for the older generation as well

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The detailed ones would be sort of brightness ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So on front ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : about the number .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um the volume up and down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : A mute button as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And probably a power one as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Numbers is ten ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : volume is twelve ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And a mute , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And then at the back ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : You've got brightness and contrast .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh there's audio functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well shall we look into that and just get back together .
