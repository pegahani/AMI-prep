dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then it should have a next button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Now there should be a memory switch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So this is one one of the interface which can be created .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this comes with different colours , different shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Uh any comments on uh her presentation ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it should be strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And it should be recyclable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : this is a normal remote controller .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh or we can use solar sells .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We don't have a lot of time left
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and we will still have to make a decision ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Simple is beautiful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And eye-catching is important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : This could be uh one feature which could be sellable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : What kind of energy do we foresee ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think I think battery ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I think we all agreed on that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Trendy design , compact and strong .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Not sure what they mean by supplements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches .
