to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I will open our functional design meeting .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements ,

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
to --> D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Um , so you're participant two ?

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : did you save your presentation ?

to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : One one .

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm participant one .

to --> C,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Three three , it's three

to --> D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Isn't that technical functions ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's David Jordan . Course .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Offer
D : The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : A very good example is Google .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Offer
D : So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Offer
D : which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .

to --> D
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : So you propose to to have the
to --> D
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : remote control which will be powerful .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : With sophisticated functions ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : and very easy to use .

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's maybe difficult to have both ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
A : I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : But if we have very very good user interface
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : it take less time for user to learn how to use it .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I propose a nifra infrared base

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it's cheaper than laser , so .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I have some kind of pictures

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you have the other subcomponent

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : There's a wire with remote control ?

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think it should be wire wireless re remote con

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .

to --> B
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea .

to --> B
dialogue type : Be-Positive
C : maybe it will be cheaper I dunno

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Do you think it will be cheaper ?
to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Could you answer please ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Offer
B : Have to think about the question ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So just trying to answer all the questions ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : We had one hundred subjects ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : um , we observe their remote control use in a lab
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly ,

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , the the look is is bad for them

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it's too many buttons and so on .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh users are actually zapping a lot ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .
to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
A : R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?

to --> C
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , I think possible .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : but do you think it will be easy to use ?
to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .

to --> C
dialogue type : Suggest
D : you you can have a switch menu ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but it has to be intuitive .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and also you can control your uh recorder .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
C : but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : new information about the product requirements ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because now everybody has internet at home ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : so it's better to use internet then teletext .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and also the remote control will only be used for television ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So has to be yellow .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : As we say , we put the fashion in electronics ,
to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
to --> D,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Require lot of requirements ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : There's that box in the T_V_ ,
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't think it's popular ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think it has to be yellow .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I will close the meeting ,
to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : um just after that we'll have lunch break .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .

to --> B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Component component , yeah .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think the um session is closed .
to --> D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . Not in mine .

to --> C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : But I dunno , but why ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think it would be simpler .
