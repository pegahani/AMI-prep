to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls ,

dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
A : Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Get the good points
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh try to merge them into one universal remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because we want to we want to well fifty million ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I also think we should not add too many buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And stereo uh s uh audio installations .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we look at competitors
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : It has to be different and familiar at the same time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you can make it uh triangle shaped ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but that's not uh very recognisable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : N we can use uh it as a as a game pad .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but young people want something different

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It shouldn't be boxy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I don't agree with the long box uh shape

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and you can make it another shape ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No that's ol old fashioned .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : It shouldn't be too boxy , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but a also with round edges of course ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : A big recognisable button on top or something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and maybe we should use colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : That's kinda trendy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Sound nice . Yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well it's just uh about our first ideas now

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Yeah now we can still talk about the material ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : infrared beams an infrared beam I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and you can always use a front front on it , you know ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : You can use it just plain
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but you can To make it more trendy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well you can make profit with them ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and it's a way to make them trendy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But people of often don't like bright colours or something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have to make it grey or s or black .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Finish meeting now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so
