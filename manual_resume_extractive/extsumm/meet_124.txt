A : I didn't know if you received the same mail .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : as I saw in my mail .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh did any of you already do some work on this part

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause we have three design steps

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I started I started with the first phase ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I had to focus on the working design , which you said .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : I basically had two points .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I got another point .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That are the the basic options for a remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but you might wanna use teletext also .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean , what functions do they have .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um especially what are their shortcomings ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users ,
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh I'm thinking of early adopters ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because they they use new technology first ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No n not specifically .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I got some uh requirements
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it has uh it has to be user-friendly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh really easy to use buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : not not uh very small buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but not the the also the big big buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : It has to be a small unit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh and a and a good uh zapping range .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we can go ahead with what we have .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I will summarise the things we discussed
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : and put it in the project folder .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it seems you get more information by email .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : After that we are going to the conceptual uh

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Y you do some individual work ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have meeting ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : individual work , meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And at the end of the day we have a final meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think that is the user requirements part .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : But but we need good communication about this stuff ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I I think we have first to start with the basic functions
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and we can uh expand them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So you can switch to your video
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then the same buttons control your video .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And you you don't need that for a T_V_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so I kind of need to know what we uh need .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And um reserve the possibility to add other features .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have a basic starting point

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and you can always extend that

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Th the least amount of functions possible

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Let's see what we got to do .
