to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh I'm Nick Debusk ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm the Project Manager .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I am Corinne Whiting
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I will be the Marketing Expert

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : , I'm Ryan .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I'm the User Interface Designer .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um in the concept design , the user interface ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm Manuel
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um .
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product .
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we are putting together a new remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we want it to be something original .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : fashion um conscious electronics company ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we want it to be trendy um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we want it to be easy to use .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then we can go into how we're gonna design it

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : function of remote control is just just

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : change channels is its main function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I suppose you c try make it a universal remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think they all work on the same prin principle as well

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : like a tracking device

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you could whistle
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : or make a noise

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : there's a button on the T_V_ that you press

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and it'd beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so they're kinda like long and rectangular .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Do we want something crazy ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : we want something new that's gonna stand out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe like user-friendly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so there are always the some restrictions

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : How sturdy is it gonna be ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : It could be cased on the outside
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and t everything could be inside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We want it to be a b a ball ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I could draw sorta the ball idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : this is where it's connected together ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so maybe as simple as possible ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : um as few buttons inside as possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : um the ball is a nice idea
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because of it's stability really ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but that's of course a weak point , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's not innovative ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : everybody does long remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : My idea was just to have it be kind of like a
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : keyboard type shape , you know , like video games

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We could also try to do the hinge thing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so it could like flip out that way .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Because even I suppose even with the ball

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : if it's small it probably looks better ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : may not be th as functional .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : say we went with the ball the ball function
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : to make it easier to hold on to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And then we have the problem with the hinge .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so then we forget the ball .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we've got our sort of keyboard kind .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Question is what makes those game pads functional ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think that's pretty much the form for full hand .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and Batteries go weak as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So that either way you're pointing it it would work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : just to finish up ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : should we s go with this plan ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around ,
