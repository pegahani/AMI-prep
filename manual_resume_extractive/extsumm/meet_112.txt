to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

dialogue type : Inform
D : so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I've I've got one at home .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we've we want different functions
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Waterproof ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .

dialogue type : Suggest
D : Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : how much is left in the battery .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But they'll also really drag up the production costs ,
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so think we'll have to see about that too .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But maybe just a little LED ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And we can all work uh on our own projects .
