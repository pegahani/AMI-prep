to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion ,

to -->

C : I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh there might be some impossibilities .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I have some uh initial ideas about some things

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : One thing about uh interopera operability .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but that's uh something we should discuss

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but take these things into account when you start the discussion .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the way how it should be controlled by the user ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : devices ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yes , I think it should be something like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , I do I don't know that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : don't have the information for it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Or are there any o other controls ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And um it's very easy for a user to to switch

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : to to switch b uh between uh channels
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so you must point everywhere ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe not even pointed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Stall
B : You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And of course you don't always know where all buttons are ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so it should be visible al um in dark too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh I think most most things have already been said ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But uh lots of devices already use infrared .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like uh control multiple devices .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we'll probably have to implement that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um you said something about visibility in the dark .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but it it can be quite simple ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : The uh the the digits in black .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh then it's already visible in dark .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : well , it can be for design , of course .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So that's a big problem , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : twelve Euro fifty , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The cost price is very low .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : um or it should not consume too much um power .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's use uh a lot of uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Well does it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I know it from the cell phone .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work uh quite okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we will go back to our own uh work .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and um , well , you know your o your individual actions
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : See you in thirty minutes .
