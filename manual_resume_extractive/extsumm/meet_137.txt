to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , teletext goes out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I I disagree ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and they don't want it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It sh it should be there , the manual .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Next point . Um R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's going to be expensive . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I don't have any information on that . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : No , we'll look we'll look into that later .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They also like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think that's uh difficult to realise also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We don't rule them out uh yet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I've some couple of pictures here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It has uh very little buttons and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : High tech .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and it's not very user-friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That's very irritating , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And I have some pictures of the inside workings ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah . Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um This one is engineering-centred ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I um I kinda like the shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We can put it on the on the back side .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We can make a symbol of the company right here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : Yeah , I will .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we've uh chose for the younger one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : but what kind of features ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Which programme you are l watching or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think it should be at the top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh well I think so , yes . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : No but we're we'll have to look into that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We don't want them to look like a calculator .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think it's still important to have it at the top ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because it's uh it's more familiar that way .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think we have uh a few functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Channel , yeah .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Volume control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the mute button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And and a volume control also in it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : No I don't think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Right , just make some decisions .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and the design comes into the next round ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Alright so no button for that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Th that's a bit uh waste .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You can just put it somewhere

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Why go to video ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So we still have one uh four ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
B : Yeah , alright .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Menu button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah . I think that's important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : No not clickable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
