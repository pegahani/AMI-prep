A : Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm Fabien Cardinaux
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We are talking about the project plan ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I will ask you all to do the same .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control .
