dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : welcome back . At the functional design meeting um
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh I had an email from the from the management board

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but there were four points

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : uh which uh I think are very important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh second one is also important

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um one hundred respondents were involved
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : two audiences ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I don't think that's uh really appropriate .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Switching channels , um yeah ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um the second , teletext ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh and the third , uh volume controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : my personal preferences . Um ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : that's a cool idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but if you don't use them , yeah it's

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : so focusing more on the used buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , perhaps .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and um I viewed how how they w looked ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh what kind of components are involved ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and those uh have a transmitter
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that's also focused on infrared ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so that would mean extra cost for the user

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So that's probably why most controls are still infrared .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : maybe uh maybe something to look into ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I figured that would be best ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : displaying to the user that something has happened .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the signal goes via chip
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then it's processed
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then it's sent to the infrared bulb

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : my personal preferences here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we should uh look into the design and the functionability .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but we we should stick to the basics .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so use as as little functions as possible
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but s I don't know in how far that is possible ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : since we are sticking to uh um infrared
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and and the remote cannot receive anything ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but uh we might uh consider that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So just keep it simple ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : make clear buttons , easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I prefer to use it only for T_V_

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and so that's where the difficulties lie .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : or do we want to use um many buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : that in the middle are the the main keys ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : is too complicated for most users .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The extra functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : then I'd like to make a proposal .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If you make one big touch screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : keep the buttons always available
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : that they always um make the same buttons accessible ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : like building in uh some kind of PIN code

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : uh if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Is that possible to use or no ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : that actually depends on the television ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the the channels are different on each te television ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : th th those things are nice .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but I think that's we wel later in the stage .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : W we are aiming for younger people

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I th I think we can do that too .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we must keep it simple ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but have the opportunity to uh have more options
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and have them uh hidden or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there are universal d um um remotes
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And it's not too complex to do it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and that that is bit of a tricky job .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well then you have to buy a new one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : or an update , software update .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Um m for which one are we going ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : my vote goes out to the right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I was uh doubting about which one to take ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : but uh you've convinced me
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh I will put my minutes

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have now a lunch break , finally ,
