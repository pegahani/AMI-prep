to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : So we come to the third meetings .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and now we will talk about the conceptual design .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we will talk about some specific details .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and have which components was uh available to build a remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So uh it's a point to discuss .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because it's trendy

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : What is this single curved

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah the um that's the point .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So the titanium case is the normal case that
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'll show you some pictures that I have
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever .
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : There's another point I want to make ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So the here are some examples .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So they cluster the buttons together .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : They group them into col they colour them
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and uh they have different forms as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but this interface are kind of confusing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh basically there are too many buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So some people are propose voice recognition

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the machine are reply to you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so we might consider that , supposedly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then there you can u you can use that as buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Touch screen , I mean .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so there are a few aspects that I collected here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : basically they are programmable ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then they also secure uh covers , to protect
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Mm maybe useful for children ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is another company that provides big buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I see that that is useful for old people

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But for our product we don't need a big one
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh , this is another one

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So there's a up arrow and a down arrow .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so it's confusing interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Big buttons are convenient ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : voice recognition helps ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh user customisable is important
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and finally simplicity simplicity is the key .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we have many concepts there
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and we should have just a button like help
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and you say uh and you ik you press the button help

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah . That's a good idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So you are display on the screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So that eliminates all the complicated documentation ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But people are often enough looking at the help ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
A : In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And let us see what the market demands .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Can be used by both kids and old people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and maybe you can just change the um the buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you turn the other side you get the other buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and how it could be special from the other remotes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : on the speech recognition if the technology is available
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And also the cost for the speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Ask our R_ and D_ department .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : say eighty commands or so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And also the scroller button , how much will it cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : one to go up left right down and uh enter
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think that there's no contradiction here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the third problem was to find the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But they are just less used compar

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You will listen to a peep , special peep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so we have some one charger there

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And that's a good idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because there are problems with a voice command .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean charger would be fixed
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because it's always with electricity plugged .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You never get it lost

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And of course the final point is a fancy look .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : But you can have an button for child lock .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think these other four points they're the market demands
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and you can say to your remote control like uh sports
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we have a problem there .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That will be too big .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you just use the control button uh ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you just you you just choose the the option you want

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : well I think that's a good uh a good option
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think these are the practical problems .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we need to take care of them in the design .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's time to close this meeting .
