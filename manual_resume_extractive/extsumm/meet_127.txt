to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because that's going to influence our design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because we have a problem .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : It has to be twelve and a half .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You're going to redesign something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , so we're at twenty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I mean we have to drop on everything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But we don't have any basic options any more .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : They don't need special colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : we need one integrated button for everything then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Could drop the speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah . Let's drop the speech .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So let's go for the plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So the only option is an hand dynamo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Woah we're within budget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We all have to keep in mind what has changed now .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we all have to uh agree on a certain level .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it does .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : It shows the relevant and most used functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : It automatically has the the programme and the volume function ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Okay five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , I say two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : . So maybe in the middle or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : The remote control is easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's really not easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : uh the remote control is durable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Okay I will go go for two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , four is okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah just add them and then uh divide them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then you can count them together .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's uh three uh Or le less than a three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : makes three point one one one one one one one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So we're better than average .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yes , so the It tells us something , yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but maybe you can help me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
D : The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : uh can we do a print ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm not sure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : We have the original balance sheet , or

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Shall we do the logo in black or not ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Is this uh the last assignment ? Or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well it's it's single single curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .

dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ?

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Assess
C : But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make .
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that ,
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah . Especially after the first meeting .

to --> ,C

C : Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but only the the financial parts uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So and the uh about the board digital pen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Because it it it just works better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
B : Finish meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think the PowerPoint is is too limited .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well .
