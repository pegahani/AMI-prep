to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Right , so agenda of the first meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We uh are to get acquainted .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So does everyone want to say who they are ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm Robin .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm the Marketing Manager .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm Louisa .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm the User Interface Designer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm Nick .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I am the Industrial Designer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And I'm Alastair
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I'm the project leader .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : so tool training .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : Project plan .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Neither am I .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have the project team , which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and to to be trendier , to be with it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we've got tool training .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Try out whiteboard .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um I'm gonna go for the dog ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So uh any any thoughts ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Is this just a television remote ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : basically I'll get back to you on that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So a device for for all remotes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Comes to your whistle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Next meeting in thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause you want you want simplicity as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And so these are probably mutually exclusive options

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : For U_I_D_ the technical functions design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Marketing , the user requirement specification .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Is this a mun multi-functional one

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That's true ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_ .
