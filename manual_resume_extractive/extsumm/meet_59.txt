to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It does look very cool .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Then I need to say some st a few things about finance ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : It's a bit um phallic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we have the user interface o in here
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um it could be made a bit smaller ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then , well this is on off button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and and also the colour is quite often red ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The volume is is scrolling .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : On the side ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But if you hold it in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : You can't really see it in the interface .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : If you take a note of them ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe give it a five , I would say ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Or maybe six ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : th there's the locator dot .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Mm that you stick on T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : To make it beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so that's seven , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'd say six ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So , should we maybe say f a five

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But otherwise it's superb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : So , should we give it a six ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay , so we give that a six ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : G_ technologically innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : All of the components have been used in other things before .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : What do you reckon , five , six ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Six .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Put fashion in electronics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So , we need the average here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : So I think we've done very well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The average is about six and something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Six point five , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : that's pretty good , I think .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And now we have to calculate the production costs .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I started filling it in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No hand dynamo , right ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : One simple battery .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Case material we said rubber .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I don't know what special colour means .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think something coloured ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have pushbuttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we have L_C_ display

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And button supplements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We've got more than one pushbutton though ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : That seems unlikely .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have to count all of them ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I don't think that makes sense .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Our budget's twelve point five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so that has implications though for the .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh it does not have for voice recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but it does have for the feedback speaker .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Mm and the locator also goes away .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Right , so we need one fifty off .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Take it down to just a scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you can push this one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So that's point three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The scroll wheel is on the side .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We're point three over at the moment .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and just have pushbuttons for the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Oh look , we're way under budget

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : No , I don't think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because we keep all the features ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we keep voice recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we keep L_C_D_ display .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But we lose the locator .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so we still have the locate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We're gonna have a beep .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It can come in the same colour as the the case .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the whiteboard digital pens .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : We like the pens .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean that was fairly tight anyway ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : New ideas found .
to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : Not quite sure what about .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well it's it's it's pretty new ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : costs are within budget ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um we've evaluated the project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Can you put that in the project documents file ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : we've got like five minutes left .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but if we've finished , then we've finished .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
D : Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So I would say that's the end of that meeting .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Was there a questionnaire already sent ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
