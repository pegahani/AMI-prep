to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , this is uh first meeting of this design project .
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : this is the the plan for today's meeting

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um specifically the whiteboard over there .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : come up with some preliminary ideas about it .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we've got twenty five minutes to do that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : There's the functional design of the the remote control .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um similarly with the conceptual design ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and then the detailed design will come after that .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : We'll pull it all together .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and draw your favourite animal
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So , my name's Cat

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um this is a rabbit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I am the Marketing Expert

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um so my name is Maarika .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I'm the Interface Designer in this project

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but I do like dogs .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um my name is Gaurav .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I'm Jen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's a gecko .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and I'm your Project Manager for today
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and my role is basically to keep things going
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Something that's a little less crowded than this ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : But what do most people do ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I mean we can think about all these little things ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : A big learning curve , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so we need to wrap it up now ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but im basically you're looking at the working design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you're looking at the technical functions design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and for you it's the user requirements specification ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh I'll see you in half an hour .
