A : This is the functional design meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : First we need to determine the user requirements

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : These are two examples .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Seventy five percent think they're ugly .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And so people say that they typically lose it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh yeah , that's what my web site said ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We could definitely include that if we wanted to .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um power source , I figured , batteries ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so a large on-off button would probably be good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Like that we know the battery's working .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We should make it glow in the dark .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Well , should it be larger buttons in general ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : New product requirements .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : non-technically challenged people are gonna use it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we we need a like homing device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's really the people twenty five to thirty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We could just have the logo in yellow ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um U_I_D_ the user interface concept ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and you're going to do some trend watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : or maybe a yellow light for the keys .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well , we definitely need those .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : or no menu buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed ,
