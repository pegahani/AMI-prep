to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : which means I will make uh minutes

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um if I'm right , there are three presentations ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation .

to --> A,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .

to --> A,D,B,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : on a little print plate

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is sent to the television set .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh and the technology's already available ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : adjust volume , that kind of thing .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : There are some uh examples of remote controls .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : You can see they are very different .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance .
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you could reuse the buttons

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so the buttons sh should be that small ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : or shouldn't be that complex

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Remote control has to have to have a low power usage ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so those they those have to h be find very easily .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : or in L_C_D_ screen .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because they use the remote control often more often ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and are more technical than the ol older people .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but also somewhat on the elderly people .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext .
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh the remote control should only be used for the television ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : otherwise the project becomes more complex ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products ,
to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions .

to --> A
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
B : you said it should only uh work with one appliance ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah . Only be used for television .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Then it should have uh on , off ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Standby options ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : and that's that's not relaxed

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen .

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
C : But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : A touch screen uh probably uh even more .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> C
dialogue type : Inform
D : I don't have any costs here ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen
to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
C : and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it's the most easier thing ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : but also on the older ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : what else does our remote need ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Suggest
B : A mute button .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : and power s power usage .
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And a teletext , but that is not of the question .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Assess
B : they are less important ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but I think they should be there ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but in a sub sub-menu or something like that .
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : power supply is one of the most important things .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it ,
to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And go to standby mode when you don't use it ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : of put it in a recharger . Charger .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So we are going for the for the recharger .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : that's also a a a great advantage
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : because you can't lose it anymore .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ .

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen ,
to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons .

to --> D,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And you said something about speech recognition ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : twelve fifty , twelve fifty .

to --> D
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : I know let's do a speech .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient .

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
A : But when you look at the percentages

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : But would it be useful to imple implement both ?

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , if the costs al allow it .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : but how would you like to implement that ,
to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : that you say volume up , and then it goes up ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Certain systems already exist , I think .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then you also have to have different languages if we go international .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
D : But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : you can use icons

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : it should be done . If it could be done , should be done .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : so we only do this when we have enough money left .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : You also now have colours .

to --> B
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
D : Curved ?

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu ,

to --> A,C,B,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Aren't we forgetting something very important ?

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : wide screen , high screen , different things you have ,

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : Channel settings .

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : and the buttons , should they have colours ?

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Inform
C : Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones .

to --> B
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : make it available in different colours , you mean ?

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : signal for las final five minutes .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote .

to --> B
dialogue type : Inform
D : you only have channel button or volume button .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So we don't have any normal buttons

to --> D
dialogue type : Inform
B : But that's also in the L_C_D_ ,

to --> A,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe only the on and o on and off button .

to --> D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ ,

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ ,

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Suggest
A : There has to be a on button on the remote ,

to --> A
dialogue type : Assess
B :No
to --> A
dialogue type : Inform
B : you just tap I think .

to --> B
dialogue type : Suggest
C : because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button ,

to --> A,D,C
dialogue type : Inform
B : But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on ,

to --> A,D,B
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .

to --> D,C,B
dialogue type : Inform
A : So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all .

to --> D
dialogue type : Suggest
A : that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote .

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting ,

to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : for now , we're having a lunch break ,
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles .
to --> D,C,B,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach .
