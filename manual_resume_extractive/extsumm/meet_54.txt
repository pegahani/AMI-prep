C : mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : rather than having a functional look and feel uh good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : okay , so the interface concept um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um so the method , we looked at existing designs ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There's um an L_C_D_ thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Again that's just quite boring shape , grey ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Um this one I thought was really cool .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and it's quite an organic shape

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And this one , the over-sized one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : the raised symbols I thought were good ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's a it's great , it's a good idea ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I like I like the colourful buttons as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Child-friendly , I thought this was good ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : And I'm gonna use the whiteboard ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : just 'cause we haven't used it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then we'll throw in our new innovations um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and there's a a chip , a processor ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um latex , double-curved , curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And that would k also give it kinda durability

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So multi-coloured buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Like uh an hour glass kind of figure ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : How would you point it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : There's a good man . There's a good idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : uh I could put the microphone here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh speech recognition , I think ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : s I guess we decided on material ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We can use a hand-dynamo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It does leave them with an obligation to

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh there's solar power . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : having a rechargeable stand ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh our next meeting's in half an hour

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Or we are going to discuss something ?

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There we go . Warning , finish meeting now .
