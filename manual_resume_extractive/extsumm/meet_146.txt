A : Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Ease of use is important ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh innovation is more important ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and that they want spongy material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the corporate colours are grey and yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe it rubber

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um I mean this is how you hold a remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and still have the ease of use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have uh a curved one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : which is curved in three dimension .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We can use plastic ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh which is the same for rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We can use wood and titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we of course have the traditional uh solar power ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um of course we have the push-buttons

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and uh we also have scroll-wheels .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yes . That is possible too . Yes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um with uh maybe a channel selector .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And click it to muten the device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So it might attract uh the young customers .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's it's been done years ago
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and I don't see it anywhere now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
C : Yeah , yeah . Okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It performs the action .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : d did we already decide on the display ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : No . I don't think you need it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but they seem to like natural uh stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So it it needs to be rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the younger people liked soft material .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But they really need the regular chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So I think this is the best of two worlds .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it depends on your walls actually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yes , yes .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah . Okay , I I agree .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And for you , the product evaluation .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The casing is curved , single-curved .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Traditional batteries uh and solar .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah , with colourful rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : What about uh the finishing of the case ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's quite modern actually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um you must have a red uh on and off button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it should be a full colour cover with such an image

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The scroll-heel . Yes ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the voice recognition we already decided .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because they're they're rubber too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'm I'm not so sure ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I have to ask with manufacturing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um I guess you two have to figure that out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : We use the regular chip ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Regular .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh I think our customers will go insane .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .
