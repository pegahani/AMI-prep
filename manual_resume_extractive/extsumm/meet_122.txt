dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : welcome everyone to our next meeting .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I'd say let's start with the first presentation .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Um in the same order as last time ?

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Components design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : the case was is made from rubber , I suppose .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the uh titanium was also an option .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But uh it's a very expensive material .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh titanium uh you have to paint it
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and with that uh it's possible to scratch it

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's t two dimensional .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : I think it's uh it's best to draw

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I thought of an idea like this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So it also looks nice when it's on your table .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but it's c it's stands .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And um it should be made of strong plastic
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and it should be bright .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : there should be some more uh investigation on that side .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and it answers you .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Um perhaps it's useful ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : perhaps for because people um lose the remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : And then I have to go out of the presentation
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And perhaps we could uh implement that .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then the buttons above and uh below
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think it's not really on scale and and so forth .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um an options button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so that it's better in your hand or something uh .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the third thing is it should be easy to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : They liked square shapes with round edges .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And hard materials like wood , um titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's it's a bit like a banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And for the elderly people just plain old .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : or was it two colours ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps you could find something in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : round corners , but s but square , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But maybe then both groups won't buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but I think it should be larger .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , three quarters .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Larger I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Looks a bit like a Game Boy now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : between the young people ? Fresh , exciting .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And the old people , old and boring .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : So we have to decide if we're going to use
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
D : real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : Soft rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah it's quite hard
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but you can press it in .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So we should first decide about shape , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You always touch it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And we won't include a a pen , or something to point ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we we want to do it with our fingers ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
B : Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but that that can be with plain soft tissue .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we can discuss these points .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : those points um energy question mark .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : are we going to do it with separate docking station

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh chip on print and case .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think energy were batteries

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : The docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We already decided that on the previous meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : which you can recharge through the docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : if the badg the batteries are dead
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : then you can re you can uh change them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but it should be th I think normal batteries ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Um what was with the chip on print ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
C : Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You still have a print plate .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we wanted to make it from rubber

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : but but a hard rubber like this ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Or softer rubber

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh hard rubber I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have different colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it's more round than square .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it meets more the young people than the older people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But that's what we want , .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I thought that was a quite good

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh got a single curved uh rubber

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : you c you can draw it on your paper

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And load it on the the user the server .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : The other buttons and on here the top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think I would put a plus and a min uh here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And then the P_ in the mid in the middle

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We'll leave that to the usability engineering then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : But I'm going to look if I've got some examples

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So not how much n not how often it's used , but

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : W what's what's usual or normal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because I have two televisions at home .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : One is horizontal ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : one is vertical ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it does it doesn't really matter ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we have we don't have to decide about that now

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : And the speech uh shall we implement that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But then you should also find a place
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : you can make a very sensitive microphone ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But that's not import I think that's not im very important

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : between the round of the R_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : just 'cause other remotes don't have that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because a microphone is very small thing ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but you can make it look like it's big
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so as its its really an important function of the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Interface type .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : If you want to go back you have to back button go back ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the the young people do like uh scroll uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : there's our five minutes uh warning .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : what's the standard colour ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we have different colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You should you should have a black one
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because uh I think black is standard .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's better to have silver nowadays .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : w what about a yellow thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it'll be a banana yellow , we have .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Green , wood , brown .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : uh that wraps it up ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Everybody knows uh what to do ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : but do we have to stay here ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out .
