to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but uh it didn't work out too well ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We're gonna have uh effectively two pages ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think we all have a presentation again ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : For the components design , um next step is
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Then there is a chip
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and still the sender .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um yes including the power s supply as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's a dynamo .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's a kinetic option ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I think that was gonna cost a little more .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which I guess is just the same as the standard ones .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What would be the cost do do we know ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it does affect the printed circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh but I don't know ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : so that is something I'll have to look into .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I mean one way is to do each of the presentations
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the scroll wheel required the regular ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : The display requires an advanced chip

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And note that the push button just requires a simple chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So maybe just a simple push button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it is basically the concept we discussed before .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so we'd have a simple circuit board

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so we'd stick with the simple circuit board

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : W w kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Are we going for speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Just just for the call and find thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's it's just an addition thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And so we would want it in as an extra

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um okay , so very brief presentation , um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : All of them have a lot of buttons there um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh it was quite uh a swish model ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but they don't look as sleek as other models .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : There was children's remote ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : where um they just had a very limited range of buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and they were b uh bright and colourful
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then you could have additional features

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You'd have model one , model two and model three ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um just to avoid ambiguity .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So , be careful what you put on the buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and be careful of the shape that you make them ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So maybe we could have volume written on the side

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And second , there should be some technological innovation .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then also try and add in technological informat innovation

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : or or you know , do they not matter that much ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe just one button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Maybe that could be a little apple .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : to something which is maybe more universal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe still with a rubber design we could

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
A : Rubber buttons require rubber case .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You could have your company badge and logo .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into .

to --> 
C : Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We'll go for single curve , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the rubber push buttons , rubber case .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . Or veg .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Could be a red apple , yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever .
