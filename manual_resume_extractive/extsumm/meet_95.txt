dialogue type : Inform
A : Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's a pretty simple design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : It's um based on a mango ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we have the company logo here

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
D : where's the L_E_D_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then the other one is the power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So it's palm-held .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : buttons are accessible from your thumb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So one plus one would be eleven ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : You press a plus button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I've never heard of that kind before .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : we can further define that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : Do you need to do a presentation first ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Evaluation criteria is next in line .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : We've been quite successful with the rubber coating

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The look is a little bit more playful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I kinda I like the potato look .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : It's a two ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and the use of the rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : there's no L_C_D_ control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we'll put three ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but I think we actually reached our goal .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Uh , will it be easy to use ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah . One .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : you can't really get confused with that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : The plus number thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But once that's figured out , it should be fine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Is this a good-looking remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Again I think the colour comes into this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think that the logo could be smaller .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : where's it gonna sit in your living room ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Okay , so should we say two for that ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : And the kinetic energy part .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : About ten pounds .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But you don't have to buy batteries .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So in the long term this can actually save you money .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I would give it a two still though .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it does very well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Okay so one ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : is the alarm system still was it implemented ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You press the button it makes a noise

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : We can give it a one ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : The plus thing needs to be worked on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : we'll say yes it's uh one ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Two okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So it could be grey on the banana one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think this is the
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Four I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But maybe more like two

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah it is one point nine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um we're using a regular chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um , we're using plastic and rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : and also our personal coach helped us along the way ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think we worked great as a team .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : We needed more Play Doh colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : The computer programmes are good .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Fantastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
B : Thank you very much .
