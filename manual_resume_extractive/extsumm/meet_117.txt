C : I was a little short on time ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , same here .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : so I showed uh show them to you .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I just got a email from the from the personal coach
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and it should be a T_V_ remote control only .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : All these points uh we have to look at .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we have to look at that as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I've used a marketing report on uh the site .
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh I think you've uh read it too .
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I didn't get it uh anyway .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I I was the only one who get it .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so we have to make a beautiful remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : The last point is quite an interesting

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we should have the ten percent on the on the top ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so when you clap your hands it will beep or something .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh you must find it uh quickly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we can uh combine that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control .
to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : But it's uh a tough one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We didn't uh think about that already .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but they're more critical .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And older people uh want to spend uh more money .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Offer
D : I have my personal uh preference .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : that's not very good ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Inform
D : But it's already out of the question , this .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Um my point is , well , I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I told about the home station .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh it must be simple ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And I I found a motto .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we put the fashion in electronics .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But old people are not looking for that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But we have to make sure that we're better usability ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So make it just a different colour or different shape ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Technical functions design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But um we have elderly people ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so we need to keep it simple .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Not too full ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : the options that we put on there should be easy to use ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and 'cause you have more room then ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and for elderly people big buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh an icon on it or text on it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so it's very clear what that buttons does .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Could I think of favourites ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I always look up the same um pages on text
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and always have to click the number .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : So you might as well remember the number .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Maybe i maybe it's too complicated ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : If I don't do it , maybe old people

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : They don't like new features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Stall
B : Right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : play , pause . I dunno if that's usable

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : that's the only th the only thing you need .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh uh the p uh next and previous .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Li like a web browser ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Six seven eight or five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Like a web browser back button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but I think it's all too difficult for old people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , the ten plus button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So you also need a menu button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then uh navigation uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because you n almost never use menu button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You'll also have to use a mute button

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
A : I don't know where where you have to put it .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Offer
B : now my personal preferences .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh using the standards , basic
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Maybe we can give it out in different colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It's like a iMac or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But it looks cheap as well ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it's a small thing .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : maybe you can look at uh mobile phones .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : They they're uh designed very well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But uh well , I think that's a good example .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : the working design .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um basically what happens is you press a button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Red's l shows up like something's wrong ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and green is like it's okay ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : on most uh uh remote controls it's red .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have a recharger in it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
A : If we can still make that then

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's just to indicate something's on .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That it's working .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So that it can be used with all the T_V_s .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We have to really understand what patterns are used ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Otherwise it won't work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : we have to uh make buttons for that as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The chip um uh is producing the pattern .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : An automatically search function for each television , or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I I use a universal uh remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And you have to put in a number ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I have a modern one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And the modern one you you uh you type uh search ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And then you know , oh it it's the right one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : what you have to do is uh get these patterns right .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And then he saves that setting

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Um that's connecting to all the components .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : when you press a button , a switch get closed .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So the chip knows what button you pressed .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So you see green if you push that button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : But does it make any difference for the energy you use ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : i it it will look different ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But if we use a battery station ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Maybe what Paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : But you have to make a sound device in it then .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : twenty five Euros , I think we can make it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But but we only have to make it for television ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : and um we must have something special .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But we lose about ninety percent of those options .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh . We have to give our customers some extras .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out .
to --> ,C
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because I was short on time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have some new uh project requirements .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We have to have a look what they are .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I'm not sure .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I don't think so ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and it's it's on your comp it's on your television .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's only one button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We definitely should use it . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The remote control should only be used for a television .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And um the the forty plus people , I already told you .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Oh , this is a problem .
to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Oh sorry about that .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So it should be flashy or just more interesting .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : that's It changes things .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I just I just didn't read it well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : That kinda changes the whole situation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : then we have to make some nice features .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I I don't y you'll use it often ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because you can see on the television wh what channel you

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : That's very That's fancy . That's cool .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I don't think it's very expensive actually .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I didn't have information about that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : that's a problem ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh only in English . Only in English I think .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Offer
C : it's probably my job to figure that out ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : then th we have to think about that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have short time to to put it on the market ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Okay , no speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , I think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : It lights up when it's dark ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : If you push something , it it all lights up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : it it mustn't work all the time .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : It uh uh it have to work only when you use it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Different colours ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : uh maybe use even different fonts .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : so y you just make it th through You look through it ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
