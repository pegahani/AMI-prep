dialogue type : Inform
A : Today , functional design phase .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The functional requirements , it's uh uh very important for uh the user ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we can we can hide those under a menu or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
D : Yeah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : some technical functions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , it's true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You have the the power coming in ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You have infrared

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I don't think we should remove the button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : um the younger people were defined under forty .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : which is apparently black and yellow ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and just make changeable covers for your

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think this is a good idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Y Yes , I think so too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : For example , a little T_V_ guide .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I'm not sure it's even possible ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : I have to check that out ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : just make a button on your T_V_

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : we should go for that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
C : then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Speech recognition , I think it's very hard ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because we're selling across multiple countries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : maybe a little harder plastic

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's not even a bad idea .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : something I have to look into .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you have to come up with a components concept ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : you should do some trend-watching ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think it should be have less or l very little buttons
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because we're working with different types of television ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : That is true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : I don't think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : A double-sided remote control ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I don't think that's useful .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : if you can put some research into that , if it's possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think it's possible ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I thi I think so too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : And uh with different colours uh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : I'll put some on paper
to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
B : and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Think it's like this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , in the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : We could do that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : uh the power button somewhere over here ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I usually press it on top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : Mute .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but just take a look at it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But I think that will cost a lot .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Uh a normal wire would be better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm not sure if it costs a lot ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think this is a brilliant product .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Could you post some other essentials of what people want ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Where would we want the uh teletext button ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Do we put it somewhere over here ?
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Or maybe this is something for the next meeting ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : draw us up some some designs of of possible
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but that's what we stick under the menu button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
C : Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , just look at the possibilities then ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we should do a little thing about design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : because it looks boring really to me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Different colours maybe .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And the design , it should differ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : But nee the function of it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have three people saying it should be on top .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Do we put the volume control and the channel control here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : In the middle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I think the channel button should be in the centre .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : but we do agree that we keep this at the centre ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : But it has to be a little bit heavier .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , let's think of a name , okay .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I I'm not sure .
