dialogue type : Inform
A : 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . Um
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm gonna open .

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
A : I'm gonna take some notes .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : We're gonna all do a presentation ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions .

to --> 
dialogue type : Backchannel
A : Components design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So you've also got um you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh it's two double A_ batteries .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : This is pretty standard remote .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So here are options for our power sources .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh we've got solar cells ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I like the kinetic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We have uh choices in materials
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and choices in the general shapes that we can do .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
D : whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : But basically these are curved and double-curved
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I I believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I have no idea exactly what they're talking about ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think curved means just curved in one axis
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and double-curved is curved in two axes

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um okay , with the interface we have the following options ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we can u we can use push buttons ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and L_C_D_ display ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : or multiple scrolling wheels .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : For electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A simple chip , which is the least expensive ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but I have no numbers to give you ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A simple chip is required to operate push buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's the end of my presentation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Oh interface concept .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : They say they could put it to work
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um we don't think so .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Well then why don't you just press the up button ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it's a bad idea frankly .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Well , we wanna small r remote control one side
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but without with a l a less complicated um design ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : so something looks good
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh is not too prone to get lost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Trend watching I guess .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Are you talking about the picture ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's not our that's not our b design ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because we don't have a product to market yet .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Uh I like the idea of of the scroll

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I give me a lower price ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : give me a higher price ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : give me some new technology ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : or develop an integrated new technol technology .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Do we go basic or do we go for features ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What type of casing ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and then it's not really rubber

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : where there's you have plastic bits

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : So the scroll wheel , in or out ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Mm pr my personal preference is out .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I I think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : How would you program it though ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well you just it's one extra button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You say programme start , and then type in

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And again we have another another great marketing tool .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : The problem we're gonna have is making it robust .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We want a mode indicator .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We want back-lit buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I would say thirty five to forty .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But you've gotta think who our target market is

to --> 
dialogue type : Offer
C : Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : The next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we've got more than a thirty minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for
