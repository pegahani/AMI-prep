to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So final design . Final design .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is a teletext button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this is the uh the infrared uh port .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : No eight or eight or ten hours of working .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : And what about people who want to use digits ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we have to go through now evaluations .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Why this strange factor of seven ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Yeah , it's fancy , according to me .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Seven . Seven by me .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah uh five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Functional .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'll give five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well it's not a universal remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Four .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : Okay cool ? Cool device .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : There I'll give it seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I would say five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I say I said seven .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Of course I'll buy the banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I'll say five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I find it quite cheap actually .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : don't forget who we're targeting also

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : No , it's I . I would buy

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : So you say two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I say five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : I stick to five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : No uh let's say I'll put two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I'd say a three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So it's somewhere three point five I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um well we are going to calculate the production costs .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We should we should be below twelve point five .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well we decided against the solar cells so

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : No kinetic also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And we have sample speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : we're just using the the very beep simple beep ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I put single curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : To reduce the cost , it's okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Too expensive .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Okay so special colour , yellow .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We don't have any push buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Okay it's gonna have to be plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Make it plastic instead of rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : so we have margin for that stuff .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Offer-Or-Suggestion
B : So what do we do with the extra profits ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : So we can go to through to project evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : No we have a product which none of us would buy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Okay so um project process .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : pointless .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : I think we we can go

to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : Okay so thanks very much .
