dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : welcome everyone .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um as you may have noticed I uh
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : created separate folders
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder ,

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Suggest
C : save in the folder . Save as project .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : Um I'm still going to take some minutes ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation ,

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : This is about the total remote control .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : We made it green .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh the screen light blue .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And the R_ and R_ logo ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Big microphone .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : perhaps you should make it a bit big ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : so people know it's there

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : You push the scroll button

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and the opportunity to use the teletext ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes . In an apart uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps we should use the teletext sign

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but It's the button where you can switch channels .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And uh in the middle the the mute .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh battery indicator .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : That's the logo of the

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : One means absolutely not true ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : seven means true .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : is the remote control fancy enough ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : is it in innovative enough ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : and is it easy enough to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Is the design fancy enough ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : It uh oh it's in the background . Oh .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Uh make it uh rather thick on the top ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because uh on the top it has uh the screen ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : I think yeah , the battery should be in here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Assess
D : all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Alright , it's a one . Oh it's a one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , I think two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's very fancy , I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it is ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : And uh uh the scroll is rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : because they're right on your screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : The options are it uh little bit harder ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : It's easier than the regular uh remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
A : A two , okay ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Is it innovative ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : For young people I think it's easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : As well for the for the older people ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , as well

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but they they don't want the uh extra options ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : then you say the question and the answer .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : a three ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .

to --> ,D
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : 'Cause we make them in different colours ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I though w we had about single colours ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
D : Also with rubber ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : You can make a print on rubber ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : The material used is spongy ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : that that's uh that's a one ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it's a three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Remote control is hard to lose .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : yeah it sh and it's easy to find .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think I think this is a two , personally .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so then this is it is almost true ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it will ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : No , I don't think very true because the colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's a three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because w we designed it for young people especially ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Because younger peoples are cr critical
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I think they like the speech .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : L_C_D_ screen and scroll .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : It has relatively few features ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : those are features .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The microphone is a feature .

to --> 
dialogue type : Stall
B : No ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : aren't the features

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : and that you can change the channel's feature ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it's it's it's a one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Uh it's not the colour ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : so maybe you should make two ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : you have the black one .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : And we'll probably make also a yellow one .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but the logo is on on the front ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it is ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : , I'm not not convinc .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think it would be a t yeah , two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : So two , yeah . The average is a two .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : so it's pretty good .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : but I am willing to try it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : Because we are going to look at the finance
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and we're going to calculate the production costs ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : we're good ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and if they're not we're going to uh re-design ,

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : but we have to do that uh very very quick I think ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : The microphone .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Offer
A : so that I can also uh take minutes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : uh count uh number of functions ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because for every button you have to pay
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : A battery . One battery ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : advanced chip ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we have sample speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : we already on nine .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Single nee single curved .

to --> 
dialogue type : Other
D : Rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : No , we don't have push button .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but with special colour we have .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : A special form ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : We don't got the button supplements .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Eighteen and a half ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : We have to lower it with six points .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We could lose the curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Nah .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : We could lose the scroll wheel .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button .
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Normal scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : And I think we should lose the curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we should scrap the sample speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : then it will won't uh stand up from the table .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
B : Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : Scrap sample speaker ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : you should you should drop the speech recognition .
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And then you can keep the curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Or make it on a hand dynamo ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but I don't think that will work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
D : Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : We could make it titanium instead of rubber .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : What is special colour ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
B : Is that the wood uh wood uh

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I think it is .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Th then we still have too much

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : three . Point three .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : That's a scroll wheel .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Don't make it wood .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
B : a all kind of colours ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : special colours , fruity colours .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : but it's a special colour than just rubber colour .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You have to add something to the rubber to make it green .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : then we have to scrap everything we got

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : then it's possible to make .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You lose this one , you got eleven point five

to --> 
dialogue type : Comment-About-Understanding
C : How d uh uh how many colours ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : but we're gonna make it yellow uh red ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .

to --> 
dialogue type : Fragment
D : I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : So each remote with a special colour .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : I think you pay half per remote .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we have um advanced chip on print .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
B : So it would be curved , single curve .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : Perhaps you can save this one ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Suggest
B : and then copy or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : but this this new remote we can afford .

to --> ,C
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : When did you receive this list ?

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Inform
A : I just received it .
to --> 
dialogue type : Be-Positive
A : They don't work so hard at the finance department .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : Um and did you try to make a new design ,
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : or what were you trying to do ?

to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : I tried to copy that one ,
to --> ,B
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it didn't work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : because I think uh we have a prototype now

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
A : And you can't erase this ?
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Assess
A : Hmm , strange .

to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : just leave it at this
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : and quickly save .
to --> ,A
dialogue type : Suggest
A : Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : what did you think about uh the process ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : How satisfied are we ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : Deadlines were sometimes very short .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : Bu but stressful .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Now we worked through each other ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : you had information I didn't have

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and you had information I also had ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
D : or maybe session of five minutes together or something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : but but why not work here together , for example ?
to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Inform
C : Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : probably to simulate the whole working uh process ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : But the technology was uh fantastic .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Yeah , the technology's okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I I don't really like the board ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but sometimes it doesn't erase

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so
to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
C : and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : but it doesn't really work all the time .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation .
to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : and what about uh this digital pen ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : I didn't use it at all .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : it's quite handy I think .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : it did work pretty well .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : It's b bi little bit too big to write .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : and what about the teamwork ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : Team work was okay .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I think it was great ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : Yeah , well I think so too .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : Only thing that we worked through , past each other .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : the leadership .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
B : I thought it was good ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : yeah , no prob . Ah .

to --> 
dialogue type : Elicit-Assessment
A : And creativity ?

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : when we look at this I'd say we have been creative ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
C : it was the idea to be creative ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And you get get stuff from the from the computer ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
C : The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : You just sit there for ten minutes .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
A : At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : No , I I never got that .

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : I got like one email after ten minutes or something .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
D : I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
B : And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here ,

to --> 
dialogue type : Inform
D : and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control .

to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but after all we can say uh we are satisfied ,
to --> 
dialogue type : Assess
A : but it it could've been uh better .

to --> 
dialogue type : Suggest
A : we would have gotten uh more information .

to -->
